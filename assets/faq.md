- How do you pronounce your surname?
  - `O-Bear`
- Where did "GeekyAubergine" come from?
  - Long, long ago someone misheard my surname as "Aubergine", this nickname stuck immediately. At the time I was watching a lot of [GeekyLemon](https://www.youtube.com/@GeekyLemon)'s videos, so I "borrowed" the "Geeky" part
- What's up with the silly names?
  - These are a collection of actual mispronounciations of my name and other funny nicknames I've been given or come up with.

Don't forget to add your name ðŸ˜Š

- OMG! What font is that? I love it
  - The main text is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont). Both accessibility minded and pretty!
  - The headings are [Wilco-Loft-Sans](https://simplebits.shop/collections/fonts/products/wilco-loft-sans). God it's pretty
- Why are your tags/categories Upper Camel Case?
  - Because screen readers struggle to read single-case hashtags, making each word a capital makes it likely that the reader will say each word separately. You should do this too ðŸ˜Š

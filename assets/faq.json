At the time I was watching a lot of [GeekyLemon](https://www.youtube.com/@GeekyLemon)'s videos, so I \"borrowed\" the \"Geeky\" part\n- What's up with the silly names?\n  - These are a collection of actual mispronounciations of my name and other funny nicknames I've been given or come up with. If you want add to them open a pr request for the [silly names file](https://github.com/GeekyAubergine/zoeaubert.me/blob/main/src/_data/sillyNames.js) and I'll get it merged in. Don't forget to add your name ðŸ˜Š\n\n## Website\n\n- OMG! What font is that? I love it\n  - The main text is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont). Both accessibility minded and pretty!\n  - The headings are [Wilco-Loft-Sans](https://simplebits.shop/collections/fonts/products/wilco-loft-sans). God it's pretty\n- Why are your tags/categories Upper Camel Case?\n  - Because screen readers struggle to read single-case hashtags, making each word a capital makes it likely that the reader will say each word separately. You should do this too ðŸ˜Š"

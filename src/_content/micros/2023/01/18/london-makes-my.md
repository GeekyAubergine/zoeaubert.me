Nice day exploring London. [St Pancras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Pancras_railway_station) is gorgeous, with [Paddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Paddington_station) ranking a close second. [King's Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station) is lovely too. It's a shame it's mostly behind the barriers. The [Elizabeth line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_line) is good; I'm a fan. The shops being surprisingly quiet was a nice bonus.

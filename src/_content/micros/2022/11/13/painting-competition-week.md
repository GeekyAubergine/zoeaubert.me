[Painting competition 2022](https://geekyaubergine.com/categories/painting-competition-2022/) - Week 6:

After 4 weeks of no progress, thanks to Life™️, it felt good to finally make progress. Got most of the models primed and some base layers down. I'm going to miss the deadline for the competition, but I will see this project out.

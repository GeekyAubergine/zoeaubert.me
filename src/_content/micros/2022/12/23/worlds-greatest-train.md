[World's Greatest Train Journeys from Above](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt25436306/) (S1) 📺

5/5 - I know I'm a train nerd, but this was fantastic. I think I have some new travel goals. The [DHR](http://dhr.in.net/)'s [NDM6](http://dhr.in.net/dhr-locomotives.php) was a real delight, it reminds me of a mini [Class 08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Rail_Class_08) 🥰. Also the [Hudson Bay Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Bay_Railway_(1997))'s [green and white stripe livery](https://www.flickr.com/photos/23711298@N07/3043205943) is 😍

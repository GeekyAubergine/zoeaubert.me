My first Civ6 domination victory. I got lucky with a pair of early wars, leaving me an entire continent. The Mapuche's [loyalty tricks](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Mapuche_(Civ6)#Toqui) are fun, it allowed me to take a few cities and let the rest fall to me through loyalty issues. They're a fun civ to play, I would recommend them.

Decided to try [Asda's Plant Based Choc Chip Cookies](https://groceries.asda.com/product/cookies-donuts-scones/asda-plant-based-choc-chip-cookies/1000333726911), they're _very_ nice. I think they might become my go-to cookie. Modern vegan food continues to impress me, they're far better than any of the vegan cookies my friend got me to try years ago.

Had a great time at [Fareham Model Railway Exhibition](https://fareham-mrc.org.uk/railex/). It was my first time going to a show since moving to the UK, and it did not disappoint. Thanks to the [Bridgeburry Gate](http://www.bridgeburygate.com/) team, who thoroughly explained their ingenious n-gauge uncoupling system.

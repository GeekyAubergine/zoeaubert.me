[The Birdcage](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115685/) (1996) üçø

2/5 - I have mixed feelings about this one. (Spoilers ahead). There are some lovely moments, but some of the main characters are awful people, and it's never resolved. They get away with treating people poorly when they should know better (Val), and it's frustrating they're never really confronted for it. I guess you could argue that part of the social commentary, but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth.

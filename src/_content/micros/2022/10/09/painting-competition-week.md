[Painting competition 2022](https://geekyaubergine.com/categories/painting-competition-2022/) - Week 1:

I didn't make much progress this week, these models are very intricate and are taking me much longer than I expected to build. Hopefully, I'll get more done next week, as I'm a little worried about missing that deadline at this pace.

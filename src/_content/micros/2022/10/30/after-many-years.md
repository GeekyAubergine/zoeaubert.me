After many years of playing the trumpet, I'm giving the French horn a go. Ended up going to the [Paxman](https://www.paxman.co.uk/) music store and selecting this horn. While many of the techniques are similar, the difference in fingering positions and [intonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_(music)#:~:text=In%20music%2C%20intonation%20is%20the,singing%20of%20an%20opening%20phrase.) makes me feel like a beginner all over again.

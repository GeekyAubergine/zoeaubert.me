This year I decided to take part in a "pick a random start collecting box and paint it" competition. I happen to pick the [Genestealer-Cults](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/combat-patrol-genestealer-cults-2022) box, which was the 4th largest. Which, as a slow painter, is scary. I now have 8 weeks to build, paint and present these models.

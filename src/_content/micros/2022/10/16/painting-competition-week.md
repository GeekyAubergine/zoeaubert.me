[Painting competition 2022](https://geekyaubergine.com/categories/painting-competition-2022/) - Week 2:

Made some good progress this weekend; 21 models are done. That still leaves a squad and the truck. Aiming to have all the models built and primed by next weekend, leaving me about 4 weeks to paint them.

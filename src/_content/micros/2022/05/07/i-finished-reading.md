I finished reading [For the Emperor](https://micro.blog/books/9781800260146) by Sandy Mitchell ðŸ“š

4/5 - A great entry into the world of Warhammer books, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It conveys the grim darkness of the universe while being comical and approachable. I highly recommend it. I'm looking forward to the rest of the series

I finished reading [Caves of Ice](https://micro.blog/books/9781844160709) by Sandy Mitchell ðŸ“š

4/5 - It's hard to talk about this book without spoiling it. I enjoyed it a lot and ended up reading it surprisingly quickly. I'm _very_ tempted to start a "small" Imperial Guard collection for [Ciaphas Cain](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Ciaphas_Cain) and friends.

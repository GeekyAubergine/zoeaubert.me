I've finally won my first Civ6 game. I was going for a religious victory but somehow ended up with a diplomatic victory. And it was on prince difficulty! (I was worried I'd have to lower it). Shout out to [PotatoMcWhiskey](https://www.youtube.com/c/PotatoMcWhiskey)'s videos, they taught me a lot and re-ignited my interest.

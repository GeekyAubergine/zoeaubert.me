Finished reading: [Deathwatch: Shadowbreaker (Warhammer 40,000)](https://micro.blog/books/9781781939635) by Steve Parker ðŸ“š

4/5 - Good read, the plot is engaging, and the imagery is well thought out. I was previously interested in [Deathwatch](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Deathwatch), and this book has only interested me further. What surprised me a little was the interactions between marines of different chapters, which only adds to the depth of their character. Some basic familiarity with 40k, the primary loyalist chapters, the [Inquisition](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Inquisition) and many Xenos factions is essential to get the most out of this book.

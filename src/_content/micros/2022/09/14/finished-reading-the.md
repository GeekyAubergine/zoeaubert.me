Finished reading: [The Devastation of Baal](https://micro.blog/books/9781784965938) by Guy Haley ðŸ“š

Excellent book, the descriptions of both the [Blood Angles](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Angels) and [Tryranids](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Tyranids) are amazing. I would highly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of either faction (or space marines and Warhammer in general).

### Rational

For a long time I've wanted to share my photos on my website. I've never found a social media or similar site that does anything close to what I want, and they have the obvious issues of not owning the data.

###Â What I want

- tags
- descriptions
- alt tags
- album description
- searchability by tgs

### Issues with Gatsby

Previously my website was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I chose this for a number of reason, mostly because I had the intention of building a few fun things in React and I thought it would be easier to just import it rather than doing the extra work to get it working with a non-React site.

Using Gatsby was going well in the start. It offered everything I wanted and the plugin support was fantastic. Things started to fall apart when I tried to do host my photos on it.

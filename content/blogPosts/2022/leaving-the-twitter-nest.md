description: A look back at why I left Twitter, some of my favourite posts and funny retweets
tags: ["Life", 'SocialMedia']
---

Twitter had never really captured my interest. I used to be, and still mostly am, a private person who rarely shares what they're up to with the broader world. This led to me tweeting very little and primarily using it to doomscroll and retweet anything that caused a reaction in me.

With that said, there were some good moments, either inspired tweets I've retweeted or when I really gave it a go and tried to make it work. This will be a guided tour of everything that made me laugh or reminded me of something good when going through my Twitter archive, so enjoy.

Going forward, I doubt I'll use Twitter for anything other than complaining to companies. I've moved to [geekyaubergine.com](https://geekyaubergine.com), which is powered by [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) (a community/platform I'd highly recommend looking into).

## My Tweets

### Top Tweet

2020-02-11

Shocking Straight Brexit Banana. As soon as I saw this, I knew I had to reference [the straight banana rumours](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/en/news-and-press-releases/euromyths/bendybananas.html) surrounding Brexit.

Covid meant I couldn't go home for Christmas, so I did my first-ever roast. Very successful, all things considered, and I only set the fire alarm off once.

I owe a lot to this mod (maybe not my windmill design skills). I learned many programming skills on a fun project I was motivated about. It's a shame it never went further than prototypes, though it was highly ambitious.

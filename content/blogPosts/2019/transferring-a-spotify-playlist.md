Transferring playlists on Spotify can be a rather tedious process, there are many different approaches talked about online but I think I may have found the easiest way yet.

1. Log into your _new_ account using the Spotify app on your PC
2. Log into your _old_ account using the Spotify web client
3. On your new account create a new playlist for each playlist you want to transfer
4. On the web, click on a playlist you want to transfer and copy-paste the URL into the search bar of your app
5. Once the playlist has loaded click on a song, select all the other songs in the playlist and then drag and drop the songs onto the new playlist
6. Repeat until all your playlists are transferred

Hopefully, this will make the process much less frustrating for you the next time you need to do this.

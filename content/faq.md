- How do you pronounce your surname?
  - `O-Bear`
- Where did "GeekyAubergine" come from?
  - Long, long ago someone misheard my surname as "Aubergine", this nickname stuck immediately. At the time I was watching a lot of [GeekyLemon](https://www.youtube.com/@GeekyLemon)'s videos, so I "borrowed" the "Geeky" part
- What's up with the silly names?
  - These are a collection of mispronounciations of my name and other funny nicknames I've been given. If you want add to them open a pr request for the [silly names file](https://github.com/GeekyAubergine/zoeaubert.me/blob/main/content/silly_names.csv) and I'll get it merged in. Don't forget to add your name in the second column ðŸ˜Š

- Why are your tags/categories Upper Camel Case?

This year has been utterly life-changing. 

I know that sounds dramatic, but the changes I’ve experienced have been almost unbelievable. I’ve tried new things, found new joys, and am starting to feel like I’m living authentically for the first time in my life.

Content warning for discussions on health, mental health, weight loss, and death.

## HRT

[Last year](/blog/2024-tell-me-more/) I started [HRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy).

The change in my mood persisted from last year. I continued to feel better and better.

I might be wrong to attribute this to HRT, but it’s the only obvious external factor I’m aware of that could have caused this change in me. This theory is further enforced by the changes I felt as my dosage was changed while trying to find my ideal dose.

It’s hard to understate how much of a catalyst for change my mood became. For the first time in a long time, I wanted to better myself – in all aspects, rather than just work – and I managed to act on it.

It hasn’t all been roses. There were some hard stretches while my dosage was changing that felt even worse than previously because I knew how much better I could feel by comparison. But that has been mostly fixed and is moving in the right direction again.

The physical effects are interesting. I don’t see them as much as others do, but that seems to be the norm. It’s also been a little scary feeling some of my strength disappearing. While I’m still fairly strong, I used to be stronger with less effort, and that change is about the only negative I have. Every other aspect of the changes has been great.

I cannot overstate how transformative it has been to have access to HRT.

### NHS

Much to my surprise, in [April](/blog/montly-notes-april-2025/), I was finally referred to the NHS’s gender services. This was with a new service that had been set up to ease the pressure on the [unacceptably long waiting lists](https://transactual.org.uk/medical-transition/gender-dysphoria-clinics/).

I was highly sceptical at first; it all seemed a little too good to be true, but they’ve been fantastic. I had my prescription on my first appointment, I’ve been referred to several other services I want to use, and they’ve been proactive in ensuring I have everything I need. 

They were even able to get my GP to agree to a [shared care agreement](https://www.england.nhs.uk/medicines-2/regional-medicines-optimisation-committees-advice/shared-care-protocols/), something they were strongly opposed to with my private provider, citing ‘insurance complications’ as the reason for rejection.

This is how it should be done, and I know how lucky I am to have been moved to this service.

## Mental Health

While my general mood has been higher this year, the lows have hit harder.

### Loss of identity, trusting friends and finding new things

I thought I had a pretty clear idea about who I was, but this year has proven me wrong on so many levels. While it has been great, I’ve had – and continue to have – many moments of ‘who am I?’ and feeling adrift as my previous comforts no longer work for me.

I have my friends to thank for this. They’ve helped me break down my internal barriers, open up to them – and in my writing/[monthly posts](/tags/monthly-notes) – and find true joy in activities I would have laughed off previously.

> Don’t kill the cringe, kill the part of you that cringes

My friend said this to me and repeats it often. And they’re so right. It’s become an almost religious mantra I try to live by whenever I question doing something scary, and it’s been reassuring.

Learning to trust people has been difficult. In the past, I have hidden parts of myself – from myself and others – because they didn’t fit with my perceptions of myself and the world around me. Some of it was likely a defence mechanism, but some of it was just misguided.

Opening up to people about what I’m thinking, feeling and enjoying has been great. Not only has it allowed people to help me work through my barriers, but it’s also allowed me to form connections with people I thought I had nothing in common with, which has been great.

Being open and trying to rediscover who I am has been unbelievably rewarding. I feel authentic, or at least like I’m getting there. I no longer feel like I need to put up a façade all the time just to fit in. Turns out not fitting in is much more fun.

I may no longer have a good grasp of who I am, well, was. And I may not have a clear picture of who I want to be. But I know who I don’t want to be, and that clarity alone is huge.

### Dad

[Last year](/blog/2024-tell-me-more/) I lost my Dad, and it’s become harder to process as time’s gone on.

I hoped that it would get easier. People often say that time heals. But so far, time has only brought a greater understanding of the loss.

I suspect some of this comes from my increased access to my emotions, allowing previously suppressed feelings to surface, but I can’t imagine that it is the sole driver. I’m hoping this is just the feelings I squashed to support my family better slowly trickling out, but it is taking longer than I’d like. And I know this can’t be rushed, and this is healing, but it sucks.

I feel robbed, and every day feels like a greater theft. Seemingly, with each day, more and more things remind me of him. And each time it cuts deeper. 

I’ve had to stop listening to his music and looking at his photos. Many bands he introduced me to are also off-limits; I just skip them when they come on, and that feels wrong. I’ve found it hard to take photos this year; I’ve only done it with my family. It reminds me of many happy hours spent together, and while, on the one hand, it feels like honouring our joy, I miss his presence. This is probably further escalated by having inherited his equipment, but not using it feels like an even greater betrayal.

One of the hardest tasks this year has been becoming the custodian of his data, and to a degree, his legacy.

He had a lot of data, mostly photos, but also recordings of his old band’s music and additional unreleased material. It all needed to be secured and organised.

These tasks took forever. Partly because of the volume, but also the mental burden. I *know* that I have correctly copied and backed up his data – I have been periodically taking copies of his data for years when I visited out of good practice – but I still fear that I missed something, it’s gone forever and I’ve left people down. Terminating his services felt uncomfortably final.

### Loss of home feeling

A recurring theme this year has been that [Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey) no longer feels like home, or at least not home-home.

It’s still my family’s home and my childhood home, but it no longer has that feeling it once did. It’s left me with the question of ‘where is home?’, because [Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth) doesn’t really feel like it either. I’m not sure how to process that; it’s a weird feeling.

Some of these feelings have probably been bolstered by my family talking about moving to the UK and leaving Jersey for good. This has affected me more than I thought it would. I feel like I’m losing my homeland. I know that sounds dramatic, but Jersey is expensive to travel to, and if I also had to pay for hotels, I’d be much less tempted to travel there.

This is a confusing mess of emotions that leaves me feeling adrift. I want to make Portsmouth feel more like home, because in reality it is. I just need to work out what’s missing.

## Health

The big headline this year is health.

I have, for the first time in my adult life – well, maybe whole life – been on the right track with my health. 

It has been a series of changes that have surprised me as much as anyone else. It has completely rewired my brain, and it’s been magical. The connection I now feel with my body is unparalleled and wonderfully rewarding. 

This culminated in my hitting my late summer birthday being the lightest – and without a doubt, fittest – I have recorded in my adult life. I managed to drop ~20 kg and an entire BMI band (I know BMI isn’t the be-all and end-all, but dropping a band is huge to me.) And the only thing I can say is that I wish I’d had the drive to do it sooner. Life is so much easier and more fun when I’m not fighting my body.

### Healthy Eating + Meal Prepping

The year started with me wanting to get on top of my weight. I have been overweight all my life, and my adult life even more so.

A combination of things caused this. The euphoria I was feeling from HRT was making me want to take care of myself more, and a ‘big age milestone’ coming up was a fantastic motivator.

As with most diets, this started with controlling my intake. I am notorious for over-eating, and what I did eat wasn’t good. I’d tried meal prepping in the past to varying degrees of success, but I thought I’d give it a proper go this time. 

Having controlled, portioned, and easy-to-access meals made all the difference, and it was surprisingly how much of a change it made, both physically and mentally. It’s much easier to be well-behaved once a week when I’m shopping and batch cooking than it is to be well-behaved every time I make a meal.

I think a big part of this was that the meals weren’t boring. It wasn’t salads or other stereotypical healthy foods; it was just slightly more conscious, much more controlled versions of the food I was already enjoying. 

### Walking

To complement the healthier eating, I started walking more.

At the start, it was just making the conscious choice to walk more, and then on those routes, walking faster. This eventually led me to walk to and from work (~5 km each way) three times a week.

It was surprisingly tiring walking. It took a long time to get to a pace I was happy with, but it built a good base for what was to come, and I think if I hadn’t done this, what came next would’ve been much harder.

It was also a great way for me to enjoy audiobooks. Sure, it was noisier and required slightly more awareness than on the train. But I think that helped me retain the books more than when I was completely switched off on the train.

The money saved from not paying for the train was also a nice bonus.

### Vegan

With me getting more in control of my life, the pressure from some friends to go vegan increased. We discussed it a lot, and I eventually decided to try moving to a plant-based diet.

It started small and mostly became an exercise in slowly eradicating animal products one by one from my meal prep. I started there because it had the greatest impact on my overall consumption and was the easiest place to make changes. That proved a lot easier than I was expecting, and after learning how to cook tofu properly, I came to enjoy it.

Everything else slowly fell into place, trying alternatives until I found things I liked and swapping to them. I won’t say it’s been easy, because sometimes it’s not, but it has been a lot less difficult than I feared. There are still some big hurdles with going out and large family meals, but they are not insurmountable. 

Since the 1st of March, I have been on a plant-based diet and have been thriving. There have been a few mistakes; it was inevitable, but, as with everything, intent is the goal, and those mistakes weren’t repeated.

It took a while for the ethical aspect to come to me. The plant-based started as a ‘see if I could’, and removing myself from that system gave me the ability to look at it with fresh eyes and stand ethically against it. But as time has gone on, my feelings have grown increasingly strong, and I finally think I can use the word vegan without it just being about my diet. It’s a nice feeling to feel like I’m making the right choices and not hurting others.

I’m not here to convince you or fight you. You do you. It’s a very personal journey.

### Running

I’ve never had a healthy relationship with sport. I don’t know where it comes from – well, I have my suspicions, something to do with the physical education system being poorly thought out, ripe for bullying and not conducive to enjoyment, but who knows – but it’s always put me off from trying anything, particularly in my adult life.

I did have a brief dabble with running in [2022](/blog/2022-a-year-in-review/), but I was finally ~~bullied~~ convinced by [Wade](https://iwader.co.uk) and [Rich](https://boakes.org/) to try it again and go to [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/).

Not wanting my first run to be public, I did some training runs on my own. It was tough at the start. I weighed more than I did last time, and I had far too high expectations of myself. I ran on and off for a month before going to parkrun. I knew what I wanted to do, but it required a lot of dragging myself to even get started.

That first parkrun was both fantastic and scary, but wholly addictive. Since then, I have attended parkrun weekly and made some great friends. It has become a staple of my social calendar and kept me on the straight and narrow through some less-motivated spells. Even in the pouring rain on cold Saturday mornings, the routine and social connections have kept me going, and I couldn’t be more thankful.

As you might expect, parkrun wasn’t the end of it. I was hooked. I ended up going to multiple running groups, filling up my weekends, spending days during the week training of all things, and putting in a lot of effort to get better.

That’s when Wade, Rich, and my newfound running friends suggested I set some goals. These came in many forms, from traditional ‘run without stopping’ and ‘get to x time’, to joining some larger events (more on that later).

### Races

I was _convinced_ to enter three events last year.

#### Race for Life

The first was the [10 km Race for Life](https://raceforlife.cancerresearchuk.org/) in [June](/blog/monthly-notes-june-2025/). This was both my first ‘proper’ race and my first stab at doing anything for charity. While the race was intimidating, and I may have taken it a little too seriously, I was reasonably happy with my efforts on the day. The charity aspect was daunting, but thanks to the _encouragement_ and later sharing by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/) and friends, I surpassed anything I thought possible. I thought I was going to struggle to meet the £50 minimum donation amount. I ended up raising £600 (including gift aid). A truly mind-boggling amount of money for little old me to have raised. I am thankful to everyone who donated.

#### Summer Cross Country

The second came in short order in [July](/blog/monthly-notes-july-2025/) with the [Portsmouth Joggers Summer Cross Country](https://www.pjc.org.uk/races/sxc/). This was my first cross-country, and it was good. Living in [Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth) is great because it’s flat; this course was not, and it was humbling. But running in nature was great, and I look forward to doing it again on foot and on a bike.

#### Great South Run

The third was the event of the year for me. In [October](/blog/monthly-notes-october-2025), I did the [Great South Run](https://www.greatrun.org/events/great-south-run/).

This was by far the toughest thing I’d done so far. I knew it was going to be hard, but I didn’t expect this. 

The weather was awful. I didn’t have my friends near me and it was far busier than I had expected. This led to me feeling down and overwhelmed at the start. In many ways it was good, because I was completely reliant on myself, but that was also a lot to think about.

Despite this, I managed to pull out what I’d consider a good performance. I not only met my goals, but I surpassed my own secret goals. I would say I felt great, but that isn’t true; the weather made its best efforts to stop me. But knowing I overcame all those challenges and still succeeded is empowering.

My full breakdown of this event is available in my [blog post](/blog/monthly-notes-october-2025).

If there was any one thing I could point to to show just how far I’ve come and changed, it would be this event. Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought I’d be able to do it, let alone want to.

### Cycling

In [June](/blog/monthly-notes-june-2025/), I decided to get back into cycling after threatening to for many years. So I picked up a nice second-hand bike that was about right for me.

After some initial teething issues, I took to this astonishingly well. It has quickly become my favourite activity and has become a core part of my physical and mental health.

I don’t drive, and don’t have any desire to. So having access to a machine that will let me go _anywhere_ is a wonderful feeling. Combine that with the exercise, being outside, and all the good things that come from that, and it’s been a match made in heaven. Cycling requires just enough mental focus that I can put my thoughts in the background and focus on riding; it has become almost a meditation to me. If I need to clear my head, it’s the first tool I reach for.

Given that I had the bike for about half a year, I have achieved so much more than I ever hoped. I quickly, but sensibly, built up my volume by taking longer routes on my commutes. 

This training culminated in doing a 100 km ride in [July](/blog/monthly-notes-july-2025/) with my friend Emma and a 100-mile ride with Wade in [August](/blog/monthly-notes-august-2025/). I feared those distances a lot and was probably over-cautious with fuelling and preparation, but it paid off, and while not easy, I fared a lot better than I could have hoped. I am immensely proud of those efforts and look forward to building upon them in the future.

After falling down the rabbit hole that is the wider cycling world, I found two things of interest. 

One, I ended up getting a proper bike fit; it was illuminating. After the initial back-and-forth, we rounded in on my fit, and I was shocked by how much more comfortable it was. I’ve never been particularly uncomfortable on my bike, but this was next level. So, much like every enthusiast ever, I am now waiting to order a new bike once the one I want releases.

Secondly, [Chase the Sun](https://www.chasethesun.org/) came across my radar. An admittedly silly ride that takes you across the south of England in a single day from sunrise to sunset. I was hooked almost immediately; it’s both extremely challenging and just a little bit silly. It didn’t take long for me to sign up for the waiting list, and I am now signed up and eagerly looking forward to doing it this summer.

### Hay fever

I tend to suffer badly with hay fever. My friends and colleagues can attest to that. 

Normally, in the summer, I end up not being able to spend any time outside for a multi-week period to avoid the worst of the symptoms. 

But last year was very different. I still felt it, but nowhere near as dramatically, and for the most part, it’s been entirely manageable with my normal dosages.  

It’s hard to know exactly where to attribute this. Some of it might be a timing thing, but I would be silly to discount that some of it has been caused by the level of exposure to the outside I had compared to previous years. 

I am worried that this won’t continue into this year, and I’ll be in a bad way again, and it’ll affect my goals, but I am hopeful.

## Hobbies

Unsurprisingly, with most of my time being dedicated to sport, my other hobbies took a back seat, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.

### Warhammer

This one hurts a bit. 

I managed to play and paint a bit, but this year my pile of shame just kept growing. I know it’s a time-consuming hobby, but I wish I’d balanced my goals a bit better and made time for this. I deeply love the lore, the models and my armies, and they deserve more time.

The greatest loss here was not getting a single game in with my [Emperor’s Children](https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/warhammer-40000/armies-of-chaos/emperors-children) army. This is by far my favourite legion, and their new release was almost everything I hoped it would be, and after eagerly collecting all the models I could ever need for this army – for now, – I’ve at best built half of them.

### Gaming

Only one game dominated this year, with all my previous interests falling by the wayside because they require more time in a single session than I felt I had to spare. I did dabble in a few other games, though.

[9 Kings](/interests/games/2784470/) completely captured my attention. Something about it just clicks for me, and I ended up having a lot more fun than I thought I would with this little indie title. I ended up coming up with some rather silly strategies (which have since been patched out) to reach well beyond the endgame.

I tried [World of Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft) this year, and surprisingly, liked it. I don’t want another MMO in my life – I remember my [EVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online) days – but the game’s story elements are great, and I get the appeal.

I also started playing [Baldur’s Gate 3](/interests/games/1086940/) with a friend, and it’s slowly clicking for me. It has many RPG aspects I don’t like, but it’s still fun. I see it being influential in 2026.

### Music - Listening

Music this year has been a total curveball. I thought I knew what I liked and liked what I knew, but once again, I was proven wrong.

[Charlie](https://social.lol/@tldrqwerty) has been the biggest influence here, relentlessly sending me new music to appraise; it’s been great.

It turns out I like punk, rock and emo a lot more than I expected. And the biggest surprise of all has been [Sega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega). Turns out they’ve produced a lot of music, particularly for [Sonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog) and a lot of it absolutely _slaps_. If you’ve never given it a listen, then I’d suggest giving it a go; a lot of it has found its way into my daily rotation.

This has had the side effect of turning my ‘liked’ playlist into an eclectic mix of everything, causing some amusing whiplash as I jump between genres with every track.

### Music - Playing

While not much has happened in music this year, I have noticed a noticeable change in my performances since getting fitter. It’s unsurprising, but it’s been fun to see. 

I am also pleased with how much more comfortable I am becoming on the [French horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_horn). While it’s nowhere near the level I was on the [trumpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpet), I think if I had to pick up the trumpet tomorrow and play, I’d be at a similar level for a few days until I re-adjusted.

### Reading

I continue my slow burn through the [Horus Heresy](/tags/horus-heresy/) books. I should spend more time on this, ideally while painting my models, as I kind of want it done now but feel committed to seeing it through.

### Programming

As with everything else, my availability to spend time on my side projects was reduced, and you know what, I think it was for the better.

I’ve stopped starting and then quickly dropping new projects, I’ve stopped feeling the need to change the world with every project, and I think I have a much healthier relationship with my existing projects.

This is a weird change of stance for me, but welcome. I don’t know how long it will hold, as realistically, it’s not sustainable for me, but the 8-month pace reduction was a good perspective shift.

### DnD + Role Play

In the second half of the year, my friend asked if our group wanted to try [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&_Dragons). 

They’re a long-time DM and are my source of the ‘Don’t kill the cringe, kill the part of you that cringes’ quote. And while it was a scary prospect, I now wanted to try it after having shunned it for years.

It was awkward at first; there are a lot of rules to understand, and being silly with your friends is not something I am used to doing or particularly comfortable doing, but I powered through. Eventually, things started to click.

The biggest challenge (which is still ongoing) has been learning to role-play. This doesn’t come naturally to me, or at least didn’t. But as I tried to get into the right mindset, I started reviewing each session through my character’s eyes, really getting into her head. I’d already written a pretty good – DM’s words, not mine – backstory, and it gave me a lot to work with. So when it came to making big decisions (such as levelling up), I would take all that knowledge and reason about what choice _she_ would make and why. It was awkward at first, but it was addictive once I got it. I now think I can at least act like the character, if not always speak like her, but we’re getting there, and it’s been a fun adventure learning all this.

I think it’s safe to say I am now hooked.

In getting inside my character’s head, I started building more and more characters, to the point where I have a roster of a dozen or so I want to play in future campaigns. Working them out both mechanically and lore-wise has been a lot of fun. It’s been dangerously inspiring and has led me to explore other creative outlets to delve into this further.

I cannot thank my friend enough for showing me this world and helping me tap into this part of myself.

## General

### Travel 

#### London

I travelled to London a lot more than I expected this year. While it wasn’t particularly dramatic or adventurous, it was the first time that it clicked that I could just go places if I wanted to, and it isn’t that hard.

I don’t know if previously it was an anxiety thing, or old thinking from travel being harder because of Jersey, but travel has always felt hard, whereas in reality, it can be as simple as jumping on a train for a few hours.

### Dropping big tech

One of the ongoing tasks this year has been dropping my reliance on big tech companies. They are unethical in every sense of the word, from their political stances to their forced adoption of AI (LLMs). I no longer want to use these services when better alternatives exist, so I am voting with my money. 

This has been a long process, but rewarding. It’s nice to know that I’m doing my part, even if it is a drop in the ocean.

#### Linux

As part of this, [November](/blog/monthly-notes-november-2025), I built myself a new development machine as the MacBook I was using was no longer going to be available. 

This was a mostly uninteresting adventure overall. Mostly because it just worked and has worked without drama since. Which has been a breath of fresh air.

I do wish I’d bought more RAM. While I’ve never got close to maxing it out, it is a background thought that comes up often. And now, with RAM prices being what they are, I wish that more than ever.

## 2026

Same as last year, I don’t make resolutions, but I do set goals. I use goals because achieving a small % of them is still progress, whereas resolutions feel much more binary pass/fail. 

Unsurprisingly, my goals shifted dramatically throughout the year, and many of [last year’s goals](/blog/2024-tell-me-more/) were not met, but I did ‘achieve’ my themes. I think it would be fair to say that I completely subverted my expectations and enjoyed (and achieved) things I never thought I would. I do not feel any sadness for these missed goals; I achieved more than if I had stuck to them.

### Theme

This year’s theme is ‘Explore and Enjoy.’

I made a lot of progress last year, and I want to continue that momentum and build upon it. I’ve had a taste of the joy of being myself, and I want to keep enjoying it. 

### Goals

I’m setting a lot of goals this year. Possibly a mistake, but they seem like achievable next steps.

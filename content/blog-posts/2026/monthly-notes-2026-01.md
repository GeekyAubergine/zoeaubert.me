After the holidays and my somewhat extended break before that, this month was about resetting my habits and rebuilding to where I was.

## Health

### Food

Fixing my slowly drifting relationship with food and snacking again was the challenge this month. Since the end of summer, my weight had been idling as a result of my relationship with food drifting, and only my high level of activity kept it somewhat under control. 

This took most of the month and mostly required both some willpower to say no to sugar and getting used to the ‘not feeling full’ feeling again. It seems to have stuck again and felt like a return to form rather than something new, which I am thankful for, as I remember how hard it was previously. 

### Sport

This has been hard. I remember where I was fitness-wise in the summer and want to get back to that, but my efforts over [December](/blog/monthly-notes-december-2025) and at the start of this month showed I needed a more sensible return to form.

I spent the first two weeks getting used to my baseline level of commuting, parkruns and socialising, which was surprisingly tiring after doing little over the holidays. I then slowly ramped up the activity until I hit my peak at the end of the month, and I was knackered.

This cycle – block? – showed how much I had drifted since the summer. I tried several activities I expected to smash, only to get humbled. This was both demotivating and motivating. I know what I can achieve and how to achieve it. 

These next few months should prove interesting, as while I have a lot of goals, many of my events are a long time away and focusing on them now seems too soon.

## Voice Training

This month saw the introduction of voice training with the NHS – the NHS? Wild, I know. 

I’ve tried on and off to do voice training myself, but frankly, it’s overwhelming and hard to think about critically without it triggering lots of dysphoria. I’m not sure what I expected going into this, but it’s been a _lot_.

My coach is lovely; she gets how hard it is, and we share a common background of playing brass instruments, which I think has helped a lot, as we both have a shared language for discussing techniques.

It has gone better than I feared. After a lot of discussion about what I want, we started with fundamental exercises, such as the [straw technique](https://www.cuh.nhs.uk/patient-information/semi-occluded-vocal-tract-exercises/). This helped me loosen up a lot and has highlighted some issues that need to be addressed.

Since then, I’ve had a few appointments, and they’ve been good, though very stressful. We recently started working on vowel sounds and how to integrate them into words, and never in my life have I been so worried about counting to ten or listing the months of the year.

It’s been funny looking back and comparing it to how I learnt to play my instruments. Unsurprisingly, it’s a similar process, though with louder and more obvious mistakes. I question how I got through it and how I can recapture the state of mind that let me work through it and reach the confidence level I have with it now. I know that will likely come with time, and it’ll become second nature like music is, but that gap seems large right now.

## Warhammer

Having done almost no Warhammer [last year](/blog/2025-watch-me-thrive), I wanted to do more of it this year.

As though the Gods themselves heard, my friend asked if I played [Age of Sigmar](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/explore/age-of-sigmar) and if I wanted to enter a doubles tournament in March. After some back and forth, we agreed to play Death armies, I’d play [Nighthaunt](/tags/nighthaunt), and he’d play [Soulblight Gravelords](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/age-of-sigmar/grand-alliance-death/soulblight-gravelords).

This challenge has been overwhelming. Although I’ve collected Nighthaunt for many years, I never built or painted most of them, having instead turned my eyes to [40k](/tags/warhammer-40k/) many years ago, as that’s what people around me were playing. It took me longer than I’d’ve liked to feel comfortable painting again and to find a scheme I like. 

I managed to paint 21 models in January, which means I _only_ need to paint another ~35 in February. Though my pace has increased considerably since getting my technique down, so I’m only a _bit_ worried.

This year has been weird and difficult. While a lot has happened, certain things have left me feeling like I did nothing. Thankfully, this post is a testament to that not being true despite life's best attempts. Content warning for discussions on mental health and death.

## Life events

The year saw two significant life events take place: Losing my Dad and starting HRT.

### My Dad

We lost my Dad over the summer this year.

I haven't spoken about this much to anyone. I wasn't sure if I wanted to include it here. But it feels wrong to pretend it didn't happen.

I was returning home (Jersey) to go to a wedding, and as normal, I'd spoken to my parents the night before to confirm travel plans and such. My Mum collected me from the airport and told me he'd picked up some cold/flu thing and that I should keep my distance to avoid catching anything before the wedding. When I arrived home, he was sleepy, so we didn't really talk. I went to bed.

I was woken by a phone call from my Mum, saying that he'd gotten worse and they were on their way to the hospital.

He never made it.

I don't know how to describe it. It felt surreal. It didn't make much sense (not that these things ever do). I'm glad he didn't have a long-term illness, but losing him so quickly with no warning was unthinkable.

Jersey being Jersey, it took nearly two months before we could lay him to rest. I couldn't stay for that time. Leaving and then having to come back on short notice was awful. It felt wrong.

During this period, I was just waiting for something else to go wrong. I left my phone on loud overnight (something I've never done) just in case someone called me again. This fear did eventually subside as we were all left waiting for a date. But quickly resurfaced as both fear and dread. I had to return to Jersey, fearing that something would happen again and knowing that I was there to go through an awful experience.

Being with my family again was tough. They'd been putting on a brave face when talking to me. We managed to get through the funeral and interment about as well as could be expected. I think we were all glad it was "all over", and we could focus on healing in ways we couldn't before while waiting.

His passing unsurprisingly left a dark cloud over the second half of the year that just wouldn't pass. Despite my best efforts, I found very little joy in or motivation for what I was doing, and I ended up just going through the motions. It was a little easier after the funeral, but it's taken months to start feeling anything resembling normal again.

It does get a little easier every day, but little things will remind me of him, and it all comes flooding back.

### Starting HRT

[Last year](/blog/2023-what-happened-with-me/), I started laser hair removal. This year, I started [HRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy).

I have been on the NHS waiting list for over five years. I have many thoughts and feelings about the state of both trans and general healthcare in this country, but suffice to say it's abysmal. With the waiting list being how it is, it'll likely be another couple of years before I get a first appointment. Thankfully, I am fortunate enough to be able to afford and have access to private care instead.

I've been struggling to start this process for many years. I think it was primarily due to fear and apathy (thanks to the obscene NHS waiting times). Thankfully, I have several great friends who helped push me that last little bit and get me started on the process.

My journey has been very smooth as it goes; I had my psychology assessment in April and then my appointment with my [Endocrinologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology) in October, with my starting HRT on October 22nd.

As of writing this, I have been on HRT for three months. There were some less-than-fun moments at the start while my dosage settled, and it mixed with all the feelings relating to my Dad. But now, I feel great.

I feel better than I have in years.

## Hobbies

### Warhammer

This year has been a big year for me and Warhammer. I've read, painted, and played more than ever before, and it's been great. This is quickly becoming my primary interest, and it's nice that it doesn't involve computers.

#### Space Marines (Confessors)

The year started out productively. Not long after returning home from the festivities, I set about meeting my goals I set out [last year](/blog/2023-what-happened-with-me/) and started working through my [Confessors Space Marine army](/tags/confessors) backlog.

I painted my first dreadnought within a week of being back and had a lot of fun doing it. It was my first big model, and I was pleased with the outcome. It reaffirmed my love of big stompy robots.

I then followed it up by spending far too long fussing over a Techmarine. A lot of this came from fear of painting red. I'd tried it once before when trying to find a colour scheme for my army, but I didn't like it then. I'm very pleased with how he came out; he's become a cornerstone of my army.

#### New Year, New Army

As is very predictable, I was distracted by the prospect of a new army. This came to a head with the release of the [T'au](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/T%27au_Empire) codex. I liked the idea of a shooting army, and I was already drifting towards turning my Confessors army into a gun line army, so why not skip the middleman?

So, I went and bought the T'au combat patrol and set to work. Two problems immediately presented themselves. What colour scheme did I want to paint, and "wow, these guys are tiny". Thankfully, in my research, I'd seen someone had done them in a desaturated green, and I quickly honed in on that idea.

That's where the good vibes ended. I found painting them frustrating; small models with well-defined lines on curves really grated on me. And I was having doubts over the colour scheme.

It was around then I buckled and looked to do something different. I forget exactly how I got there (I think it was the promise of them getting a codex soon and being a small model count army), but I ended up trying again with [Custodes](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Adeptus_Custodes). This was a great move, and they've since become my primary army.

I knew I didn't want to paint them gold, which quickly narrowed down the schemes. I was left with [Solar Watch](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Adeptus_Custodes#The_Solar_Watch_-_Castellans_of_the_Blessed_Worlds) or [Shadowkeepers](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Adeptus_Custodes#The_Shadowkeepers_-_Wardens_of_the_Dark_Cells). I know you can invent your own scheme, but it took me the better part of a year to decide one for my marines, so I thought it best to stick with one I like that was already defined. I hate painting white/cream, so that ruled out the Solar Watch, and black and gold is an instant classic, so I went with the Shadowkeepers.

Thanks to my misstep with the T'au, I now only had 4 weeks left to build, paint and present my Custodes if I wanted to finish them on time for "New Year, New Army", which was the original goal. This turned into a herculean task. This was equal to the total number of models I had ever finished before in a very short amount of time. I completed them 2 days before they were due.

They are weilding large spear like weapons with glowing blue tips. Either side are them are two groups of five Sisters of Silence, sleekly armoured warriors in black and gold, with red accents. They are holding either a flame weapon or bolt gun. They are either bald and a top knot red plume, or have a gold helmet with head plume. At the back are three Vertus Praetors. They are three large jet bike vechiles each piloted by a warrior in large armour. They are black and gold with red accents and head plumes. On the front of each bike is a large golden eagle. Each warrior carries a long lance like weapon with a glowing blue tip. All models are mounted to a black and while marble-like base.](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2024/03/30/04af4049efc119b0.jpeg)

While this was hard work, I'm incredibly pleased with the results. This project coincided with me getting an airbrush, which helped a lot, but it was still the fastest I've ever built, something to this high of a standard. It was also very rewarding. Thanks to them being Custodes, this is a significant part of an army completed.

#### Getting to 1k

The most common size for a Warhammer 40k game is 2k points, but many people play at 500 and 1k points. Through my local store, I found a group that hosts smaller tournaments, so I set about getting myself to 1k points. Thankfully, because this is Custodes, this required painting only five more models 🤣.

They have tall helmets with plumes of red hair; the leader has blue hair. They are all carrying spear weapons whose tips are an electric blue.

All the models are stood on black and white marble bases.](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2024/07/21/2e3243d95f6adcbd.jpeg)

With my small force now ready to play, I started playing a few games against people. This then led to me spending most of the summer playing games almost every week. Most people had also seemingly started new armies this year, as very few people were interested in pushing it to full 2k point games, which got me out of having to paint.

### Armies on Parade

Towards the end of the summer, Warhammer has an Armies on Parade event. Mostly on a whim, and thanks to the many compliments I'd received about my Custodes, I decided to enter. I wasn't sure what to expect and had no illusions of winning, but I thought it'd be fun.

Despite stiff competition, I somehow came third. I'm sure it was primarily thanks to the Mabel bases, but this was a great win for me.

### Lorcana

This year saw my introduction to [Lorcana](https://www.disneylorcana.com/en-GB).

Many moons ago, while at school, many of my friends played [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en). It looked mildly interesting, but it never really captured my interest. In the many years since, I've occasionally looked at it, but a mix of it being very rules-dense (much more than modern Warhammer, in my opinion) and there being _so_ many cards left me feeling overwhelmed and uninterested in pursuing it.

Cue my friend showing me a new card game based around Disney.

The Disney aspect immediately captured my attention. The idea of being able to play with characters I love is great.

Thanks to it also being new, I felt that learning it would be a lot less overwhelming, and I was right. I joined just after the release of Set 3, so there were only so many cards around, and you could reasonably learn what the most popular cards do without having to learn hundreds of cards. Another benefit of Lorcana is that you're allowed to take four copies of each card, so the number of unique cards in any particular deck is greatly reduced.

I got really into it and even attended some [tournaments](/tags/lorcana/).

Since picking up playing more Warhammer, it's been pushed to the side a bit. Warhammer requires a lot of time outside of playing for building and painting, and something had to give.

I still play very casually and haven't bought any cards since the release of Set 5. I want to get back into it, but it already feels like it's at the "this is overwhelming" stage. I'm hoping that playing more in 2025 will nullify that concern.

### Gaming

This year, I played games properly again for the first time in years. This was almost entirely driven by very healthy and totally normal levels of peer pressure.

I upgraded my PC for the first time on many moons, and the difference has been night and day. The improved performance has made gaming much more enjoyable.

#### Factorio

I started strong with [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/).

What a game. I got hooked almost immediately (as was my fear) and have loved every minute of it.

My first play-through was very slow. I misunderstood the scale of what was required and tried to build a rail-based super-base far too early. This led to constant bottlenecks and poor production, which took too many, many hours to resolve. However, it was a lot of fun, and I look forward to building a better rail-based base when I have more experience.

I recently started a new play-through with the release of the DLC, and I intend to play this much more sensibly, so I might even finish it in a reasonable amount of time.

#### V Rising

My group then prompted me to play [V Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_Rising).

I never thought I'd enjoy a game like this, I'm much more of a slow, methodical strategy kind of person, and this isn't that.

I was wrong.

That game is fun, the mechanics are great, the art is gorgeous, and overall, I found it hard to put down. I'm not sure what I'd pin down as my favourite aspect; overall, it's just very good.

#### Elden Ring

I've been watching people play [Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring) and other games for years, and I enjoyed watching it, but I never thought I'd enjoy playing. However, after my success with V Rising, I decided to challenge my beliefs and bought Elden Ring.

I had a rough start. It took me a while to get into it, and I started to doubt if it was for me. But after a few hours, I started to get it. I got a feel for the combat and what the game wanted me to do. Since then, I have poured many hours into the game and enjoyed most of them. I must shout out to my friends, who kept me motivated through the rougher parts of the game.

I've not finished it yet. I'm hard-stuck on a boss not long before the end of the game, but I will persevere.

#### Space Marine 2

This was it—the big one. I'd been waiting for this for years, and it was one of the main reasons I upgraded my PC.

I don't have much else to say other than I love it. It ticks every box I could have asked for. I'm not the biggest fan of the mission system, but when I get into it, I forget all that. I just enjoy being a walking tank with a big gun and chainsword. Great game.

### Reading

I managed to read (listened) to 12 [books](/tags/books/) last year. Unsurprisingly, it was all Warhammer related.

Overall, I've enjoyed this series a lot, but there are some duds in there. I'm now at about book 19 of 64 of the [Horus Hersey books](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Horus_Heresy_Series). There's still a long way to go, so I hope the writing continues to improve as I want to read them all.

Some of these books have been surprisingly heavy and made me question aspects of myself.

### Projects and Programming

My main focus this year was my website. I went through far too many iterations, taking far too long. It's mostly finished now, and I will soon write a blog post about how silly it is. It's very silly.

I did attend two hackathons this year; the first, we didn't produce anything presentable, and the second one took far longer than it should have and is not yet finished, though I do plan to finish it and then write up about it as it's a funny idea.

## 2025

Much like last year, I'm not making any resolutions. They're too easy to fail and seem very absolute. Instead, I set goals so that if you only get halfway through them, you've still achieved something. This will be a long list because I want to do a lot this year.

There are two themes I want to introduce this year, as well as my usual list.

### Accept Good Enough

> Perfection is the enemy of progress
> &mdash; <cite>Winston Churchill</cite>

I spend far too much time in every aspect of my life seeking perfection and letting it cause me never to finish anything. I "famously" have many, many projects on the go and even more on my ideas board that I will never finish as I want them to be perfect versus just making some progress now and improving it later.

This is true of all my hobbies:
- My software doesn't have to be a perfect, enterprise-level product if I'm the only person using it
- My Warhammer models only have to look good enough for me; I don't have to be the best painter in my group to feel like I can field my armies
- I don't need the best meta-list to play Lorcana
- I don't need to research and know all the tricks to a game before I play it

Now, that's not to say I'm going to let my standards slip. But there's a big gap between excellent and perfect, and achieving excellence is far easier than achieving flawless perfection.

### Subvert My Expectations

2024 showed the power of subverting my expectations. I tried many things I didn't think I'd like, and I turned out to be wrong on almost all counts.

I have written off many things in my life, assuming I wouldn't like them. And I now think I might've missed out on many things I would've liked if I hadn't been so stubborn. I want to change this. Trying new things has been fun and rewarding and has opened my eyes.

### Goals

1. Build and paint at least two units of each type for my [Custodes](/tags/custodes/) army. Possibly even complete my pile of shame
2. Build and paint at least a full 2k point army of my [Confessors](/tags/confessors/)
3. Build and paint at least a full 2k point army of the upcoming [Emperors Children](https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/evne31tw/lvo-preview-2025-establish-exactly-how-much-is-too-much-with-the-emperors-children/) release
4. Build and play at least one game with my new [Legions Imperialis](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/legions-imperialis-lp) force
5. Take more photos
6. Finish Elden Ring (base game)
7. Finish Factorio Space Age
8. Complete V Rising

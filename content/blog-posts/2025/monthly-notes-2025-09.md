A relatively chill month. No wild goals or adventures, just solid, consistent training looking towards October.

## Running

On the 6th, I finally got a [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) palindrome time of 30:03, which I’m very happy about; it's the nicest one that I’m likely to get (looking at you 22:22/20:02).

## Resistance training

This month, I tried some resistance training for the first time. I picked up some resistance bands, as weights didn’t appeal to me. Overall, it was a positive, albeit humbling experience; muscles I’d forgotten I had really felt it. 

I feel like I noticed some benefit in my running after a few sessions, though that might've been placebo and the temperature dropping. I’ll revisit this after October’s events, as I don’t want to make too many changes, and it felt like a big one.


## Gaming

I played a lot of [9Kings](/interests/games/2784470/) this month. It’s really grabbed me. I’ve found a few broken builds that have made getting some achievements a little too easy, which is both good and bad. Good because I like getting achievements, bad because, well, they’re supposed to be hard.

## Stats Zone

- I ran 56.4 km
- I cycled 341.5 km

## Fitness

Cycling really took hold of me this month, and I loved every minute of it.

- I ran 61.2km (38.0 miles)
- I cycled 584.3km (363.1 miles)
- I spent 33h 26m being active

### Running

The big event this month was the [Portsmouth Joggers Summer Cross Country](https://www.pjc.org.uk/races/sxc/), only two days after running the [Race for Life](https://zoeaubert.me/blog/monthly-notes-june-2025/).

I was convinced into running this one by [Wade](https://iwader.co.uk) a few days prior. He said he'd done a training run there and that the hills weren't that bad.

Living and running in [Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth) is great, mostly because it's very flat. Something that this course would prove not to be. I was nervous going into it, and I'd heard the first hill was going to be hard.

So I set off with little knowledge of the course, and I set off way too fast. Got past some rolling hills and was waiting for it to hit, and boi did it. That first hill was killer. The rest of the course was lovely though, tough, but mostly forest tracks and some gravel paths, finishing with a long descent through a lovely wooded path.

This was my first experience in what I'd call non-road conditions, and it was lovely. It re-affirmed everything I thought I'd enjoy about it and gravel cycling in the future.

I also did surprisingly well in my opinion, coming in at 58:26 for an 8.3km course with 180m of elevation, which was more elevation than I'd run all year.

### Cycling

I've done a lot of cycling this month: a few long efforts, and some solid, fast-paced bits and bobs. I'm not sure if it's because it's still very new to me, but this is much more fun and running, and I quite enjoy running. I have found it difficult to balance not feeling tired from the cycling while also keeping up the running, though. I'm not sure where that balance is, but I've definitely not found it yet.

#### 100km

The big cycling milestone was cycling 100km with my friend Emma.

We initially planned to do 50km, but talked ourselves up to trying for 100km. We planned a scenic route with plenty of escape routes in case it got too much. To our surprise, it went off surprisingly well. We both seemed to be feeling fine till about 80km, at which point we were both feeling it, though I didn't admit that at the time,

This is a huge milestone. It represents a massive step forward in my endurance training and ability to perform and enjoy cycling.

## Hobbies

### D&D

This month saw me try [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) for the first time.

I've always been hesitant to try it, thinking it wasn't for me, but the opportunity came up for one of my friend groups to play for the first time with an experienced [DM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master.

We've not played a lot so far, and I'm still finding it awkward to get into it, but I've had a lot more fun than I'd've expected to.

I did have a lot of fun building my character and backstory. After some consultation with the DM, I probably went a little too far with it, but it was my first attempt at creative writing in years. It was surprisingly easy once I just accepted it was going to be awkward and rolled with it. I suspect this is going to be true of D&D in general and should probably be applied to many other aspects of my life.

## Fitness

- I ran 35.5km (22.0 miles)
- I cycled 459.7km (285.7 miles)
- I spent 24h 36m being active

### Running

#### Breaking 29m

This month on the 2nd, I managed to improve my PB further down to 28:47. I think the sun not being out and it being slightly cooler was a huge help here; it was a really hard effort, but it confirmed that recent performances hovering around the 30-minute mark weren't the end of my progress, which I was slightly concerned about. It was a nice reward for my efforts in all the heat.

#### Jersey Parkrun

During my trip to Jersey, I got to do [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/jersey/) there. This was huge.

I had an unhealthy relationship with the track where it takes place, stemming from years of terrible P.E. lessons and the like, so it was good to go and fix those memories. I have a few other places I need to do that with on Jersey, but this was a big first step. It was also the first time my family had had the opportunity to see me and my progress, which was very rewarding.

To my surprise, both of the runs were sub-30 minutes, which was much faster than I was expecting. The course is a little mean with long, slow hills, and is a real wind funnel, but overall, I won't complain. I'm very happy with those results.

### Cycling

Another good month for cycling, considering I was away for nearly two weeks, I'm very pleased with my distance.

#### Bikefit

At the start of the month, I went and got a bike fit. I've really fallen for cycling both in terms of fitness and just getting around, and I have some problems/complaints with my current bike (primarily tyre clearance), so I want a new bike, and I decided it was better to get a fit first. Turns out that was a very good idea.

After some general profiling questions to find out my current problems fit-wise and a brief physical, the fitter asked for my "ideal" bike, set up the jig, and it was awful. We discussed some initial findings and then started the process of changing something, seeing how I felt, how I was responding to it and then changing something else.

This process was a lot of fun, I learnt more about my body and its limits than I expected, and I was surprised by just how comfortable the final fit was. I'd never had any serious discomfort on the bike, but this was another level. It was also a lot of fun using cleats for the first time and seeing just how much of a difference that made by itself.

Overall, the experience was very positive, though the results were disappointing. I have a disproportionately short torso that complicates my fit and effectively rules out all the bikes I was interested in. This has left me feeling a little lost and having to completely rethink what I want, though I'm very glad I did this, as correcting many of the bikes I was interested in would've been nearly impossible and a costly mistake.

#### Century

The original plan was to go with [Wade](https://iwader.co.uk) on his first 100km cycle.

It went well, our pace was good, and we ended strong. I did have a slight mishap early on, puncturing on a 14% descent, but I managed to stay upright, so no real complaints.

Between us not following the route exactly and me cycling to meet Wade, we got back to his house, and I had about 120km on the clock, so being the silly person I am, I decided to try for 100 miles.

I was well fuelled and had been careful with my effort, so I was feeling strong; even so, it quickly became a slog. It was much more of a mental battle rather than physical; the last 30km or so involved my cycling around Portsmouth, which meant the whole time I was pretty close to home, and knowing that was hard.

I managed to power through and finished in one piece. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't leave me that dead. I wasn't that tired, and while I definitely took it easy, I was able to get on the bike the next day for my commute to work without many issues.

I'm still a little surprised with how well it went. One hundred miles is a long way when you plot it as a straight line on a map, and it's kinda wild that I did that in one go. I look forward to going further in the future.

## Travel

As is routine, I travelled back to Jersey this month. It was definitely better than [last summer](https://zoeaubert.me/blog/2024-tell-me-more/)'s trip, but it was just as hard.

I know it's silly, but I was expecting something terrible to happen again. I hope that will pass wth time, but it seems unlikely. It does somewhat add to my travel stress, though, which is unwelcome.

Compared to the last time I was in Jersey, I feel like a completely different person. I know I've changed a lot, both physically and mentally, but it seemed particularly stark in the backdrop of Jersey. I think this was a mostly positive experience, but it was a lot to take on.

I think these changes helped a lot to remove some of the friction with my family. We're clearly still all hurting, and being face-to-face made that much harder to accept, but my positive changes seemed to have an effect, even if it was just being happier within myself.

This was the first time, though, that Jersey hadn't felt like home. Not as in I don't belong there, but more of a "it's my parents/family home, my home is back in Portsmouth". For many years, I've felt like I don't really have a home, constantly torn between Jersey and Portsmouth, but this was a change. I'm not sure how to feel about this, but I think it's a positive change.

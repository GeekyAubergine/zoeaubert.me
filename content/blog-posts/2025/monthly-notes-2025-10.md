This month was the big one, the one all my running and training had ultimately been for, and it went well.

## Running

The month saw a significant increase in effort to stay on form for the [Great South Run](https://www.greatrun.org/events/great-south-run/).

This involved mostly doing longer runs and getting comfortable with that distance and pace. I was possibly slightly more scared of it than I should’ve been, but I didn’t want to mess this up.

An added bonus of this build was that I somewhat unintentionally set my 5 km personal best by nearly 90 s, getting it down to 27:06.

### Great South Run

I knew this was going to be hard. I’d run this distance a few times now, but that was in spring/early summer, and I'm at a different point in my fitness journey with less focus on running. Although I prepared for it, nothing could have prepared me for the day.

I was supposed to run with [Wade](https://www.iwader.co.uk/), but he unfortunately pulled his back the day before and had to withdraw. That was a real knock to the overall mood, and meant I couldn’t rely on him for motivation should things get hard.

Then the weather took a turn for the worse, becoming an absolute washout. It rained all night and didn’t let up until just before the event, and even that was a small reprieve. This made the preparation areas muddy and unpleasant. Many tried to be cheerful, but it was clear that the weather was dampening the mood. 

There were so many people.

I don’t think I've seen that area that busy other than when there’s a festival on. It made meeting up with my other friends impossible, which only further dampened the mood. I’m not the biggest fan of being around that many people, and it set me on edge.

In the chaos, I managed not to make it into the right starting pen and was released far later than I’d’ve liked, meaning I wasn't going to be anywhere near an official pacer. This meant I needed to pace myself, something I’m notoriously bad at.

To my surprise, I settled into a pace pretty quickly and managed to hold it. The first 5 km passed quickly, and the only problem was the rain; people’s race numbers were falling off, and so was mine. I managed to catch it and stuff it in the netting at the front of my vest, but it was ruined.

About the 8 km mark, I started to feel it a bit. But it was around here that I passed the aid station where one of my friends was helping, and to my surprise, they noticed me and cheered me on. That was huge and greatly rewarding. It took a conscious effort not to speed up and ruin my pacing. It was then plain sailing for a while.

It really became difficult when we reached the final home straight (about 12 km) and were fully exposed to the wind and rain. That coastline can be cold, even in the summer, given how exposed it was, and the weather took full advantage of that. My legs began to sting from the cold, and that was worse than any pain I’ve felt from being tired. 

As I entered that section, I was doing a lot of maths to work out whether I could meet my secret goal of 1:45, and it seemed doable, but those last few kilometres would have to be strong, and I’d have push in the worst conditions I had faced so far.

_Somehow_ I managed it, I slowly ramped up from 13 km to the point where my last two kilometres were just shy of my 5 km pace.

I still don’t know where I got that from, but I did it; I managed my goal with time to spare. I am still surprised with myself, and while I have already set an ambitious goal for next year, this achievement says everything it needs to about the hard work I’ve put in and how rewarding it’s been.

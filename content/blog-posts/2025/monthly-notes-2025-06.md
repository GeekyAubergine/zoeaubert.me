## Fitness

Cycling has been much more fun than I expected (more on this later), so my running suffered a bit.

- I ran 90.4 km (56.1 miles)
- I cycled 189.4 km (117.7 miles)
- I spent 19 hours, 8 minutes being active

### Walking 

Unsurprisingly, with the weather being a bit naff, hay fever continuing to be a problem and starting to cycle commute, I've recorded essentially no walks. It’s a shame, but we ball.
  
### Running

Running was interesting this month. I hit some big milestones, while also not feeling it that much.

#### Portsmouth Race For Life

This month saw me partake in my first proper ‘Race’, chip timing and all, and for charity to boot. While the race itself didn’t quite go as planned, the charity side of it has been incredible.

##### Charity

When I first signed up, I was concerned about the £50 minimum donation requirement, and feared I’d have to fulfil it all myself. I spoke to Donation Daddy, [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me), and he told me not to overthink it and set my goal at £100. I thought that this was the upper limit of what was achievable, and I’d be over the moon to achieve this.

After being ~~bullied~~_encouraged_ to post the link to my donation page on The Socials™️, I was bewildered to find I hit that almost immediately.

After being overwhelmed and fumbling around a bit, I was then _encouraged_ again to up the goal to £250, which I’d’ve never imagined achieving in my wildest dreams. From there, it just kept going.

In the end, I managed to raise £530 + gift aid.

I’m still not sure how to feel about this; it’s just overwhelming (in a positive way). It wasn’t stressful in terms of the event, but doing something this publicly was stressful, especially as it involved asking others for support.

##### The Race

I had a very mixed time at the race; I had fun, but also suffered a lot of frustration that took away from the day.

I (and a few others) measured the course to be ~9.3km, which, in my opinion, is unacceptably short. Not only did it make our pacing pointless, but it also threw off the official pacers (who I heard complaining at the end), it made our chip timings essentially useless, and it led to some people barreling through the finish line and crowds trying to finish the full distance.

#### Sub 30-minute 5km

I hit my first big speed milestone on the 7th at my 10th [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/), I managed to do a sub-30-minute 5km.

This felt like a long time coming (though not really) and was a crazy effort; I had to basically walk the rest of the Parkrun as I had nothing left. This came from a lot of training and hard work, and it was a wonderful reward. 

I was surprisingly alright afterwards and put in a solid effort the next day. I look forward to going even faster.

### Cycling

The big news this month was my reintroduction to cycling. I used to cycle a fair amount as a child, and remember both loving and hating it depending on various factors. But I felt worse about running back then, so I thought this might be worth a go.

I went out looking for a reasonably priced drop bar bike to see how much I enjoyed cycling again, and managed to find an old, but well-loved [2016 Specialised Ruby](https://www.specialized.com/gb/en/ruby-comp/p/106400?color=195597-106400) at a reasonable price. I’d done a lot of research beforehand, so I knew that this was a good starting point.

Cycling clicked almost instantly with me. I bought the bike on the 12th and managed to rack up a surprising distance in a short amount of time. I’m surprised how quickly my handling skills came back to me, and I was glad that I stopped feeling nervous around traffic within hours. 

This has been unlike anything else I’ve tried so far. I _want_ to be on the bike. The sense of freedom and fun it provided was amazing. Just being able to go places and go for a long time without seeing the same old running routes has been amazing, especially since I don’t drive.

I already have big ideas and plans for me and cycling, I’m glad I decided to try this. I do worry about balancing cycling and running, but it’ll be fun to see where this goes.

## Hobbies

### Gaming

This month saw me try a bunch of games, and I’ve found a new favourite.

#### 9 Kings

https://zoeaubert.me/interests/games/2784470/

This game has really tickled me. It’s a rogue-like deck builder/city builder? I’m not sure how to explain it, but it’s got just the right balance of strategy, while not being overly serious; it’s good.

#### Crash Bandicoot™️ N. Sane Trilogy

https://zoeaubert.me/interests/games/731490/

Many years back, when this game was released, it became the reason I ended up buying a PlayStation. I never ended up playing it that much, but boi, does this game hold a _lot_ of memories for me. It was by luck that I found it was available on PC, and it’s been nice getting re-acquainted, even if I am still really bad at it.

#### Slay the Spire

https://zoeaubert.me/interests/games/646570/

I get why people like this game. I’m not sure it’s exactly for me, but it does seem like a lot of fun if it’s your sort of thing.

#### Tower Wizard

https://zoeaubert.me/interests/games/3372980/

A nice little idle game, but it feels like many of the others I’ve played recently, and it’s not really working for me.

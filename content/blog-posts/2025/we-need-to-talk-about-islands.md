> We live in a geography.

In a recent (when I first started this) [blog post by Robb](https://rknight.me/blog/do-you-not-fear-death-sir/), he mentioned that Portsmouth is the most densely populated city in the UK. I jokingly sent him a message saying:

> whell ackchullay, only if you exclude London and you do include Greater Manchester

Ok, good meme. Well done me. This came from a weird piece of information[citation needed] that I have lodged in my head since I moved to Portsmouth and have never really questioned since. 

Robb's response was to question whether Wikipedia was correct (this is what I believe professionals call foreshadowing). I then mentioned that the statistic is also wrong anyway, as when most people say [Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth), they mean only [Portsea "Island"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsea_Island), and this value includes the whole administrative area.

We then ~~argued~~ _discussed_ what is and isn't Portsmouth, leading to the ultimate question:

> Is Portsea "Island" an island?

This quickly got out of hand. I then threatened to write a post about why I was right, and here we are.

Since then, I've brought up my point many times with many people (often to great ridicule in the face of this truth), and this post grew from outlining and defining my premise to discussing edge cases covering futile attempts to discredit my opinion. So, if you find yourself asking, "Why are we talking about the Ice Age and land mines?" you know who to blame.

This post was originally written in the summer of 2024. After being nearly finished, it then sat in my pit of unfinished projects, being poked every now and again. But after a recent flurry of poorly judged concepts to prove me wrong, I've decided to post it for real.

**Disclaimer:** For legal reasons, I must inform you that this is the opinion of one highly opinionated, silly person. While absolutely correct. I cannot be held responsible for any poor reactions you may feel in the face of this undeniable truth. As with learning anything that fundamentally shakes your worldview, don't worry; I shall show you the light.

For the rest of this post, when I say Portsea, I'm referring to what is commonly called "Portsea Island", for it is not an island.

## A brief detour into population density

Before we get onto islands, I must discuss my population density findings. I've gone far too down into this rabbit hole not to talk about this, and I will write more about it in a future post (doubt), but for now, here are some numbers.

My "joke" rests on the premise that Portsmouth is the third most densely populated city in the UK if you exclude London and only use Greater Manchester rather than Manchester.

| City                                                                   | Population | Size (km^2) | Density (p/km^2) |     |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------:| -----------:| ----------------:| --- |
| [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London)                         |  8,799,800 |    1,572.00 |          5,597.8 |     |
| [Portsmouth (All)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth)           |    208,100 |       40.25 |          5,170.2 |     |
| [Portsea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsea_Island)                |    172,569 |       24.54 |          7,032.2 |     |
| [Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester)                 |    568,996 |      116.00 |          4,905.2 |     |
| [Greater Manchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Manchester) |  2,812,569 |   1,2760.00 |          2,204.2 |     |

(These values have been retried from Wikipedia using the most recent census (2021) data. To get the population of Portsea, I used [this data](https://www.ilivehere.co.uk/statistics-portsea-island-city-of-portsmouth-31095.html))

Well, this is a little messy. If you consider Portsmouth only to be Portsea, then yes, Portsmouth is the most densely populated. But if you consider Portsmouth to include all the places under Portsmouth authority, it's the second.

So, where did this mistake about Portsmouth being the most densely populated come from? Let's look at that [Portsmouth Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth) again. 

The opening paragraph ends with "It is the most densely populated city in the United Kingdom". If we scroll down to the [Demographics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth#Demographics) section, we will see a problem. "Portsmouth is the second-most densely populated city in the United Kingdom, after London".

Wikipedia is not only wrong but also self-contradictory in the same article. Incredible. I'm unsure how this error crept in, as using the data on the article, you get the "Portsmouth (All)" values, and you'd have to go out of your way to find the Portsea data and use that.

## What are islands?

Before I present my case, I will provide you with my credentials. How else will you know my position is irrefutably correct?

I was born and raised in [Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey) (which does exist, despite what others will tell you), and as such, I know what an island is because I come from one. I have also visited various islands and things I don't consider islands.

My premise is simple:

> If you can walk to it, it's not an island.

Now, let's get down to business. When I say walk, I mean, under ideal circumstances, could you get there on foot? I guess this extends to any land-exclusive vehicle (I see you hover-crafts). Still, I can't think of any examples where you'd be able to drive but not walk it, mainly because any means to walk it would've been found/built (more on this later) before the invention of vehicles.

Before we cover Portsea, let me present some other non-islands so you understand my position.

### Mont-Saint-Michel

While discussing with Robb, he brought up [Mont-Saint-Michel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont-Saint-Michel), thinking it would blow my argument out of the water. Surprise, it does not.

![Mont-Saint-Michel, a large fortification seen from above, in a shallow bay surrounded by shallow water and sand flats](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2025/02/we-need-to-talk-about-islands/MtStMichel_avion.jpg)

(Image retrieved from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont-Saint-Michel#/media/File:MtStMichel_avion.jpg) - Fabos - CCC0)

For an island to be an island, it must not be walkable. Mont-Saint-Michel is famously walkable. The [Normandy Tourism website](https://en.normandie-tourisme.fr/unmissable-sites/the-mont-saint-michel/crossing-the-bay/) even has an entire article on it. 

Need I say more? You can walk there, and regularly enough that it's considered normal holiday activity. (Do not do so without a guide).

**Conclusion:** You can walk to it; therefore, it is not an island.

### Tidal islands are part-timers

If we read the [Mont-Saint-Michel Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont-Saint-Michel) article further, you'll notice a segment on [Tidal Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont-Saint-Michel#Tidal_island).

[Tidal islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_island) you say? Let us read:

> A **tidal island** is a raised area of land within a [waterbody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water "Body of water"), which is connected to the larger mainland by a natural [isthmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus "Isthmus") or man-made [causeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway "Causeway") that is exposed at low [tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide "Tide") and submerged at high tide, causing the land to switch between being a [promontory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promontory "Promontory")/[peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula "Peninsula") and an [island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island "Island") depending on tidal conditions.

(Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_island 2024-05-23)

So, depending on the tide, the landform is either a tall piece of rock or a temporary island. And if the water isn't always there, then you _could_ theoretically walk to it.

If we look more at this article and scroll down to the list of tidal islands, you will notice a nice long list of them under Jersey. If we recall, that's where I'm from, making me an expert on all of this. Let's look at some examples.

#### Elizabeth Castle

[Elizabeth Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Castle) is a small fortification in St Aubin's Bay in Jersey. May I present two images:

![Elizabeth Castle, a small granite fort, surrounded by water](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2025/02/we-need-to-talk-about-islands/Elizabeth_Castle_Jersey_2.jpg)

(Image retrieved from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Castle#/media/File:Elizabeth_Castle_Jersey_2.jpg) - Dan Marsh - CC BY 3.0)

![Elizabeth Castle, a small granite fort, being approached by a group of people walking along a causeway towards it a low tide](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2025/02/we-need-to-talk-about-islands/Helier_pilgrimage_2005_Jersey.jpg)

(Image retrieved from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Helier_pilgrimage_2005_Jersey.jpg) - Man vyi - Public Domain)

If you're still in doubt, I have personally walked this walk many times and have not drowned.

**Conclusion:** This "tidal island" is walkable, not an island.

#### La Corbière

[La Corbiére](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Corbi%C3%A8re#Lighthouse) is a small tidal island with a lighthouse.

![Corbiére Lighthouse, a small white lighthouse stood on an outcrop of dark brown rocks, surrounded by high tide and strong waves](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2025/02/we-need-to-talk-about-islands/LaCorbiere.jpg)

(Retrieved from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LaCorbiere.jpg) - Op. Deo - CC BY-SA 3.0)

![Corbiére Lighthouse, a small white lighthouse, stood on an outcrop of dark brown rocks and saw a low tide with people walking across the causeway. In the foreground of the image, a seagull perched on a rock](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2025/02/we-need-to-talk-about-islands/La_Corbi%C3%A8re_lighthouse%2C_Jersey%2C_low_tide.jpg)

(Image retrieved from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:La_Corbi%C3%A8re_lighthouse,_Jersey,_low_tide.jpg) - Man vyi - Public Domain)

Yet another walk I've done many times. I've even been lucky enough to be inside the lighthouse, and it's really nice.

**Conclusion:** Believe it or not, not an island.

#### St Michael's Mount

Leaving Jersey, let's look at one final example, [St Michael's Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael%27s_Mount).

![Arial view of St Michael's Mount from over the sea looking inland. It's a small rocky outcrop with greenery and a fort/castle. The sea surrounds most of the island and is at low tide. There's a small harbour attached to the mount. There is also a causeway with people walking on it](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2025/02/we-need-to-talk-about-islands/1_st_michaels_mount_2017.jpg)

(Image retrieved from [Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1_st_michaels_mount_2017.jpg) - [Chensiyuan](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Chensiyuan "User:Chensiyuan") - CC BY-SA 4.0)

Do you see all those people walking on the causeway? You might need to zoom in on the original to see them. Yeah, now you see them.

To quote the Wikipedia article:

> St Michael's Mount is one of 43 unbridged [tidal islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_islands "Tidal islands") accessible by foot from mainland [Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain").

(Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael%27s_Mount 2024-05-23)

**Conclusion:** Huh, accessible by foot from the mainland, you say? And defined as a tidal island? Damn, definitely not an island

### Pluto is not a Planet

Remember our little celestial friend [Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto)? Remember how it is not a planet but a [dwarf planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet)?

Pluto is not a planet because it failed to meet one of the essential requirements to be a planet. Therefore, it's not a planet but a dwarf planet. 

Following that logic. I propose that an essential criterion of being an island is that you cannot walk to it; therefore: 

> Tidal islands are not islands because you can walk to them, failing to meet the criteria to be an island.

Now, if you feel the distinction between a planet and a dwarf planet is redundant, then you might also think this distinction between an island and a tidal island is redundant, but you'd be wrong on both counts. I firmly believe the distinction matters. I am nothing if not a pedant. If we were to relax the requirement on planets, then suddenly, we'd get a lot more planets, and 8 is a nice number.

### But what about?

Here is a quick-fire list of things that have been put to me as counter-examples or silly edge cases to attempt to disprove my flawless logic.

#### Bridges are not a disqualifying factor

There's not much to explain here; adding a bridge to an otherwise good and proper island does not stop it from being an island. For the purposes of my argument, we are ignoring the existence of bridges as they are non-natural structures.

Note this would also disqualify a causeway that makes a route traversable. The route must have already been traversable prior to the causeway.

#### Underground bridges are the same

This also goes for tunnels. The [Channel Tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Tunnel) does not disqualify the island of Great Britain from being an island proper.

#### Ice Bridges

What about [ice bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_bridge)? For example, the [Diomede "Islands"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diomede_Islands). 

I've considered this and decided they are similar to tidal islands. This might sound weird, but hear me out. They are periodically accessible by foot, making them not islands proper.

They need to be in a different category, though. I'm terrible at naming things so someone else can come up with something cool for them. Maybe "seasonal islands" or "temporal islands"?

#### The Ice Age

What about [megaannums](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mega-annum) ago when you could walk between Britain and France (supposedly)?

Now, this is a good question. I've discredited landmasses that are walkable up to the order of a yearly period. Why not just make that megaannums? 

The question really is, do you consider the Ice Age to be a periodic event? I don't. Therefore, at one point, Britain and France were essentially one land mass, and now they're not. Maybe this is a "occur in a lifetime" kinda question.

Consider it another way: If a river separates two pieces of land, but many megaannums ago, the river didn't exist. It is two pieces of land, or one piece of land split forever by a river.

This also extends to continent-sized land masses. Many landmasses that are now separated were once one land mass, but we're not referring to all land masses as [Pangaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea).

#### Man-made Islands

Is an oil rig an island? Depends, is it touching the sea bed? Otherwise, it's just a fancy boat. And no, boats are not islands.

If you are anchored to the sea bed, then yes, it is, but only if you can't walk to it.

#### What about Moats?

If you dug a sufficiently large and deep enough moat so that it could not be walked across, have you made an island?

Yes, I think you have. Though this requires you to ensure that it never drains, if it drains at any point (like the tide), then no, you've made a tidal moat.

You could consider the area around Portsea to be a sort of tidal moat.

#### Mordor

![One does not simply walk into Mordor meme](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2024/8r0xba.jpg)

No, Mordor is not an island. They walked there. No one said they couldn't. They just said it wouldn't be simple (in fact, it was so not simple, there are three books about it).

But Zoe, it's man-made! Reasonable point, but I posit that terraforming is very different to non-natural material. If you made a bridge connecting Britain and France out of rocks and dirt, I would be tempted to hear the argument that it's one land mass.

#### Landmines don't make an Island

No, surrounding a landmass or hill with landmines to make it impossible to walk to does not make it an island. Much in the same way that a bridge would not disqualify, this does not qualify.

#### Are Whales Portable Islands?

No, this is animal abuse. Do not walk on whales.

#### But I'm a Disney pirate

Firstly, I doubt it. Secondly, if you are, it doesn't matter. [MythBusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters) disproved this.

And no, if you're one of the bone bois who can walk underwater, that doesn't disqualify an island. That is not something someone can reasonably do.

#### Ok, but what about Jesus?

If you're a deity-like entity that can walk on water, then no, nothing is an island to you. Also, I have some questions.

#### SF6

What if you filled a moat with [Sulfur Hexafluoride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride) instead of water?

The point is that SF6 is heavier than air, so it'll stay in the moat and collect in your lungs, meaning that if you spend too long in it, you'll suffocate.

This depends. Is the moat deep enough that my head will be "submerged", and is it too wide to traverse reasonably in a single breath?

If so, then yes, you've created a new type of island. If not, you've just been ruining the planet.

##### Other Toxic Chemicals

This logic applies to all other proposed toxic chemicals. If it would prevent a reasonable attempt to walk across it, then yes, you've made something that could be classified as an island. I hope it was worth it.

#### Non-Newtonian Fluids

Oo. This is a fun one.

[Non-Newtonian Fluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid) that can act both as a fluid and solid depending on pressure (stress).

Possibly controversially, I think this does make an island. I don't think walking, one could reasonably expect not to sink into the fluid and be trapped.

## So, is Portsea an island?

No.

Ok, let's actually discuss it. Let's see what everyone is claiming to be: an "untraversable body of water" ([Portsbridge Creek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsbridge_Creek)), that clearly denotes it as an island.

![A tidal creek separating Portsea (left) from the mainland (right). Seen here at low tide](https://cdn.geekyaubergine.com/2025/02/we-need-to-talk-about-islands/Ports_Creek%2C_Portsmouth%2C_UK.jpg)

(Image retrieved from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ports_Creek,_Portsmouth,_UK.jpg) - ITookSomePhotos - CC BY-SA 4.0)

Yep. That's it. That's all that separates Portsea from the mainland. This photo was taken at a reasonably low tide, but I've seen lower (sadly, I don't have a picture).

I argue that an ideal [neap tide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide#Neap) would be sufficiently low enough that if you had the proper footwear, you could find a point at which you could walk across it.

Ludicrous, I hear you say. Nay, I say. Much to my surprise (that it's documented), there's even a reference to people having walked across the gap previously in the article: 

> An army report on the status of the Hilsea Lines made in 1853 mentioned that the creek was filled with weeds to the point where for 3 to 4 hours every day it could be walked across.

Granted, there were weeds (this is some hard cope), but I'd argue that the proper footwear would counter that. And unlike this, I'm not arguing daily crossings but suggesting ideal low tides. 

Another complication is that the creek has been deepened and widened since then. Still, it's within the realm of possibility that you could cross it.

I am very tempted to record myself doing this at some point to really prove my point, but it seems like a lot of effort just to record a video of me falling into the mud.

**Conclusion:** You _could_ walk across the creek, much like you can cross the sands to other non-islands. Therefore, it is not an island.

## Conclusion

And with that, I rest my case.

If you can walk to it at any point, it's not an island proper and is, at best, some sub-category of island.

I will not accept pretenders to the throne.

And no, this is not silly pedantry for the sake of pedantry, this is very important and serious. Let this be the start of the revolution much like that that followed the declassification of Pluto.

## Further failed attempts to discredit me

I will continue to update this section with additional suggestions for ways people try to circumvent my unquestionably correct definition of an island. Note that if you send me something, I will name and shame you, so best be bold in your beliefs 😛

This has been a wild month. So much has happened that it's prompted me to write a mid-year update rather than waiting for my year-in-review post.

Despite some external forces trying to crush me, I've had a great time, continuing what is shaping up to be my best year.

CW: transphobia and government stupidity

## Health and Fitness

This month has been great for my health. My weight loss has continued steadily, and I've been more active than ever.

- I walked 184.4km (114.9 miles)
- I ran 91.3km (56.7 miles)
- Collectively, I spent 43h 16m being active

I am continually staggered by my progress. I started running in March, and here we are two months later, setting and achieving goals I thought were previously improbable, if not impossible. I am careful not to go too far too fast (ha), but it is hard to hold back when you are motivated to do more.


### Walking

While my walking distance this month has been within touching distance of the previous month, the difference in how I feel during the walks has been surprising. As my fitness has increased, they've become increasingly easy (I know it's not easy, but relatively, it feels easier. I know, I can't believe I'm saying it either).

Annoyingly, this has made them comfortable to the point where my spent calories have decreased to a noticeable level, and I have to watch my intake more carefully. I know, I know, how annoying.

Next month's goal will be not to exceed this month's numbers and instead spend the extra energy elsewhere. While it's good for endurance training and general "time on feet," I don't see how increasing it would help further. If I have the time and drive to walk an hour, I could either spend that time running or strength training to achieve greater results.

### Running

After starting running last month, through the continued ~~bullying~~ _motivation_ from [Wade](https://iwader.co.uk) and [Rich](https://boakes.org/), I started going to [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) and another running club.

Going to these events has been great; the shared efforts and group motivation are addictive. It's also much easier to pace yourself against other people and not blow up too quickly, which has been invaluable.

#### Parkrun

My first parkrun was intimidating. There were lots of people, my friends were there, and it was my first time not getting free breaks because of traffic lights. It was all built to be something I might not enjoy. But I'd committed myself to it, so I _had_ to go.

I'm so glad I did.

It was tough, really tough. Because of my terrible pacing, I ended up walking about half the course. But I enjoyed the event and set a massive four-minute personal best. I was amazed to come in under 40 minutes and thought that it was going to be weeks of work to achieve that goal.

#### Race for Life and Great South Run

After the high that was parkrun and run club, I (with motivation from Wade) decided to enter the [Race for Like 10k](/charity/rfl25) and [Great South Run](https://www.greatrun.org/events/great-south-run/). It was probably a bit crazy (well, it felt that way at the time), but having a fixed goal to work towards has been useful, if not worrying/intimidating.

When I signed up, the distances seemed insurmountable, and I had to consult many people about whether or not it was achievable, but after much confirmation, I just went and did it.

With the Race for Life being a charity event, after sorting out the [Charity Page](/charity/rfl25), it got posted in a few work channels and boosted a bunch, and the support has been overwhelming. I initially doubted I'd meet the £50 minimum, but after advice from [Robb](https://rknight.me), I decided to set the initial goal at £100. As of writing, we're at £420 + gift aid, and I can't thank people enough. It's incredible.

#### Running Non-Stop

On the 20th at one of the run club events, I did something I thought would still be weeks away; I ran the full 5k without stopping to walk.

This was primarily thanks to slotting in behind others who were running at a nice, consistent pace, but the fact that I could keep up with them blew me away.

Previously, my longest stint was at most ten minutes. The temptation to stop was constant, but as with much of this exercise malarky, it turns out a lot of the battle is mental.

It was an important milestone for me to hit. I knew I'd do it someday, but I thought it was much further away. Reaching it this quickly was a massive boost and reward for my previous efforts. Since then, it's been easier to repeat, knowing that I have done it before.

#### The 10k Wall

Since signing up for the Race for Life, I was intimidated by the distance. I struggled to do a 5k then, and a 10k seemed a real challenge.

With that in mind, I started to build my distances slowly. After the weekend events (parkrun and club), I ran increasingly larger distances home to slowly build my mileage.

This led to Saturday (26th), consisting of a 5k, a coffee break, and another 5.5k run home. This was proof that, in theory, I could do a 10k, though the idea of doing both without a break still got to me.

Then, on the 29th, I woke up early and felt the call. I'd been recently scoping out a 10k route near me and decided to go for it.

I did it.

I ran 10k.

Sure, there were some small walking breaks in there, mostly around traffic, but I did it.

Not only did I do it, but I also crushed my end-of-May goal of 80 minutes, coming in at 76 minutes.

It felt great, really great. I don't know what happened that morning, but I felt great. I ran the last two kilometres near PB pace and felt like I had another two kilometres in the tank. I also expected to be sore after it, but I wasn't. By lunchtime, I felt great, albeit quite tired.

I cannot explain how much of a confidence boost this was. The 10k distance was starting to become a mental block. I look forward to doing this regularly and pushing my longer runs even further.

I was also pleasantly surprised by how good my pacing was on that run. I've been terrible at it previously, but this was nice and consistent. A skill that will prove increasingly useful as the distances grow.

### NHS and HRT

As I mentioned in last year's [update post](/blog/2024-tell-me-more), I started [HRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy) privately after waiting an unacceptable amount of time to be seen by the NHS.

To my surprise, I was contacted by the NHS.

Due to the extreme wait lists, the NHS has set up additional services to take some of the load. This essentially boils down to (seemingly) randomly taking people from the top of the list and transferring them elsewhere. You can't ask to be transferred, and it appears pretty random. I'm unsure how I feel about the fairness of this process, but I won't lament being lucky here.

I was sceptical at first. This fits the criteria for being a little too good to be true and spooky because the NHS is the NHS, and messing with their waiting lists/transferring around could lead to some real issues for me. But this opportunity was too good to let pass, and as I'd gone private already, I could probably weather the storm.

After some phone calls, I arranged an appointment and went there with low hopes. I could not have been more wrong.

My doctor was incredible. He was kind, understanding, and proactive. We discussed a lot, but the headlines are that the NHS is taking over my prescription (I left the building with a prescription, which I was expecting to have to wait months for), they have a bunch of useful services that I'm being referred to, and they are happy with where I am.

This went so much better than I expected. I was left dazed. I didn't know what to do with myself afterwards; I just wanted to cry and let out what felt like decades of frustration.

## Politics

Oh boi, this has been a hell of a month.

While the rest of the world is on fire, the UK joined the fray and doused itself in oil to quickly catch up.

Great choice /s.

### UK Supreme Court

In case you missed it, on the 16th, the UK Supreme Court handed down a judgement essentially saying that trans women aren't women, trans men aren't men, and that the Equality Act isn't appropriate.

Absolute crap.

This case wasn't even on my radar, so when the news hit, I was completely blindsided. I wasn't sure how to react at first. I was numb, I didn't know what to think. As more and more friends came to me asking what it meant and how I felt about it, the reality hit me.

The consequences of this would be (and are already becoming) huge, and it's going to completely destroy many people's way of life.

### Words from the top

As the impact of the ruling was felt, my eyes turned to the government. While I was not hopeful, I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, the Tories in red would say something positive, or at least neutral.

How silly of me.

The PM and several ministers have doubled down.

The people who write the laws agree with the ruling and are likely to try to remove what little protections trans people have in the country.

This isn't a hypothetical. There are already motions being tabled to enact these things.

Traitors.

### Protesting

This turn of events drove me to attend my first-ever protest.

Why hadn't I been to one before? I was scared. I'd seen the problems that could go down at protests in large cities and was afraid of getting caught up. A fear that I think is justified, if not misguided.

Turns out it was great. The speakers were great, the weather was great, and the sense of community was empowering.

This has definitely encouraged me to be more politically active.

## Hobbies

### Warhammer

After a bit of a break, I finally made a start on my [Emperor's Children](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/40k-chaos-emperorschildren) army. It's good to be back, I've missed it more than I thought I had. I look forward to playing them soon.

As expected, though, I am slightly stuck on colour schemes.

### Music

To my surprise, my weekly discover playlist recommended me [Linkin Park](https://linkinpark.com/), and I liked it. This is surprising because this isn't my first time listening to them. I've tried them before, but this time, I liked them. Maybe it was their new singer that changed my opinion?

From there, I asked [Robb](https://rknight.me) for some recommendations as he has great taste in music. He recommended:
- [Paramore](https://paramore.net/)
- [Against the Current](https://www.atcofficial.com/)
- [Millie Manders and the Shut Up](https://millie-manders.com/)
- [The Pretty Reckless](https://theprettyreckless.com/)

He nailed it. These were great, and it turns out some of them were already on my liked playlists, but I didn't recognise their names.

As fitting this year's goal, this subverted my expectations, and it's been great.

### Gaming

Three games stood out this month:
- [Ghost Recon Breakpoint](/interests/games/2231380/)
- [Locomoto](/interests/games/2328650/)
- [Call of Duty: Warzone](/interests/games/1938090/)

#### Ghost Recon Breakpoint

This has been a lot of fun. I enjoy the sneaky, tactical aspect that is missing from many modern-day shooter games.

It has a lot of problems, mainly with the AI being terrible, but it's still a fun challenge when you ramp the difficulty up.

Overall, very pleased with my discounted purchase, though I don't think it would've been worth the full value.

#### Locomoto

I love this. There's not much else to say.

It's [Animal Crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing) vibes with trains, and you get to play as a cute animal? Sign me up.

I wish the train aspect was more prominent, vs just being a fast-travel-esque style system, but that's probably just the train nerd in me coming out.

Overall cosy and I look forward to finishing it (if you can finish it? I have no idea)

#### Warzone

This is a fun game to play with friends that requires little thinking.

The game itself is pretty mid, it just feels off, and the UI is _terrible_.

Overall, I'm glad it's free, and it's acceptable for that price. I would not pay for this, and I would be disappointed if I had.

## Tech

I splashed out this month and bought two new bits of tech, my first tech purchases in years.

### Garmin Forerunner 965

Since starting to track my activity, my poor old Apple Watch Series 5 has begun to show its age, and its battery suffers for it. It was getting to the point where it was struggling to track two back-to-back 5k events, and I was starting to worry it'd begin to fail mid-session.

Having enjoyed my Apple Watch, I initially looked towards their lineup. With the concern over battery life, I ruled out the standard series and was looking at the Ultra 2. Even then, its battery life was lacking, and it's hideously expensive for something so vulnerable to scratches/bumps.

In my research, I eventually came across the Garmin series of watches, and after _much_ debate, I eventually settled on the [Garmin Forerunner 965](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/886725/pn/010-02809-10). I was very tempted by the [fēnix](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/1228171), but the price was too much and other than being more sturdy, offered little in the way of benefits for me.

So far, I'm very impressed. As of now, I've had it for two weeks, and I've had to charge it twice: once when I first got it and once eight days later. For anyone with an Apple Watch or similar, you'll know how foreign a concept this is. I'm still surprised by it.

Other than the battery being great, the fitness features have been great. As others have said, this is a fitness watch with smart features, unlike a smart watch with fitness features. The tracking and insights are great. It lasts long enough to track your sleep effectively without delaying your mornings/being on charge during the day. And, possibly most importantly, having physical buttons is great as I've almost had an activity stopped before with the Apple Watch when it was raining a lot.

Overall, I'm very pleased. The only thing I miss is Apple Pay, but I can live without it. This has been a great purchase.

### Shokz OpenRun Pro 2

I have a set of nice over-ear headphones. I like them a lot, but they're not compatible with sport. They're too heavy and get too sweaty.

I decided to forgo listening to music/books for a long time and instead focus on enjoying the moment. This was good at first, but as my distances have increased, I feel the need for distraction more and more to keep the "we could just stop" thoughts at bay.

I'd tried my friend's bone-conductive headphones previously, many years ago, and was unimpressed. But, while waiting to get a new pair of running shoes, the shop had a demo pair of the [OpenRun Pro 2](https://uk.shokz.com/products/openrun-pro2) headphones, I tried them and was impressed. I was so impressed that I couldn't stop thinking about them, so I purchased a pair the week later.

I continue to be impressed. While the sound quality will never be as good as "proper" headphones, they do the job well. I've listened to various music genres, and they've performed well in almost all cases. The battery life lives up to the expectations, if not surpassing my pessimistic views of battery estimates.

Overall, another great purchase. They do their job well and are quickly becoming my go-to headphones if I'm ever out of the house, as they're light and easy to stick in a pocket.

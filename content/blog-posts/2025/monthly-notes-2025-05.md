This has been a relatively quiet month (thankfully), I've mainly been focused on steady progress with my health, fitness, and just vibing through the hay fever.

## Health

This month marked a massive milestone. One of my many secret goals this year was to lose weight.

I’ve been overweight almost all my life, and with a big age milestone coming up in September, I set myself the goal of weighing less than I have for the last ten years.

I knew this was ambitious. But it felt like a good goal to aim for, and I was feeling motivated. And like with all my goals, if I only got most of the way there, it would still be a massive achievement.

Through a combination of diet and exercise, I achieved that goal this month. A whole four months early. And I’m well on the way to being the lightest I’ve been in my adult life.

It doesn’t feel real. I don’t remember being this fit or feeling this good in my body ever. It’s a completely new experience, and I’m finding it a little hard to comprehend.

Granted, there’s still the same weight and some before I hit an ideal/goal weight, but that seems more achievable than ever, and if this is how I feel now, I can only begin to imagine how good that’ll feel.

## Fitness

I smashed it this month.

- I walked 101.5 km (63.1 miles)
- I ran 138.8 km (86.3 miles)
- I spend 33 hours, 33 minutes being active

### Walking

Interestingly, my walking distance has decreased this month (previously 184.8 km, or 114.9 miles); this is partly due to walking a little less to work, thanks to both the weather and hay fever.

Additionally, because the Garmin doesn’t nag me on every incidental walk to record it, I’ve ended up only recording workouts. I dislike that the number has gone down, but it has made my Strava much less cluttered.

### Running

This month has been great. I’ve run lots and surprisingly far. My monthly total of 138.8 km alone feels astonishing. Before this year, I’d be surprised if my total running distance in my life was that high.

#### Long Run, the First

Early in May, a friend suggested that instead of running to pace, I go out for a 90-minute ‘slow’ run. I took this to mean stay below [Zone 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/wiki/heart_rate_training/), so I set off to try it, expecting only to run a short distance.

By the time 90 minutes had passed, I was surprised to find that I’d got to about 11 km. This was already past my longest run ever, and I felt good, so I kept going.

I ended up doing a full 16.1 km (10 miles) run.

This was an important milestone, as it’s the same distance as the [Great South Run](https://www.greatrun.org/events/great-south-run/). A distance that I’ve found intimidating to think about, ten miles sounds like an awful long way, and I now know that no matter what, I can finish it, which is very reassuring.

While this was a slow run, and time isn’t important, it took 2 hours and 14 minutes. This was great; I was expecting to take much longer at this stage in my training.

#### Doing it again

A couple of weeks later, I decided to try doing it again, this time as a pre-run before a run club event.

This felt great, surprisingly so. I did 11 km before the run club (5 km) with time to spare and feeling surprisingly fresh. Getting going again was a little rocky, but I soon settled back into the pace and, towards the end, felt good enough to be able to push towards my PB pace.

Overall, I finished with a time of 1 hour 56 minutes, which was not only a significant improvement but also felt rewarding given all the training I’d done.

#### Add a Parkrun

After my first 16 km, my friend helpfully suggested to me ‘do it again before [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/)’. Ok, sure buddy, ‘just’ add on a Parkrun, no troubles.

This was going to be tough. I left the house at 06:45. I was warm, humid, and only going to get worse. And as a nice bonus, at about 8 minutes in, my watch kindly informed me that my ‘Performance Condition’ was -2, which was great.

Despite the heat and disliking the weight from my vest and water, I started to feel good. At around 9 km, I began to feel fatigued, but I pushed to beat my 10 km personal best, which I achieved by 10 minutes.

I then backed off a little and felt strong through to 14 km, where it started to suck again. I’m not sure what changed, as my data doesn’t show anything, so I suspect it was more mental than physical. Either way, I forced myself to complete 16 km, knowing I wanted to improve my time (which I only managed by one minute) and that I’d get a short break before Parkrun.

This is where the real problems began. As I’d been much faster than I feared, I arrived at Parkrun with 20 minutes to kill. This time was hard. I could feel myself cooling down and getting stiff despite my efforts to walk/jog around. I was also far too hot and felt airless with the humidity.

Then Parkrun started. After about 500 meters, I started to feel ok again. Then I hit 2 km, and while my body was reasonably chill, the mental game kicked in. I think it was a combination of being tired, knowing I was in uncharted territory, and knowing that I could run that route much faster than I was going. While I managed to stay mostly on top of my pace, every kilometre from there was an uphill battle. But I finished it.

And with that, I’d run a half marathon. And I’d done in 2 hours 28 minutes.

What a bonkers month.

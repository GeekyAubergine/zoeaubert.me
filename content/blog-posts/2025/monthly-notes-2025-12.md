This month was focused on recovery and spending the holidays resting both physically and mentally.

## Going Analogue

With the upcoming holidays, I decided I didn’t want to take my laptop with me, which led me to want to have a nice notepad and pencil. So I turned to my local pen connoisseur, [Robb](https://rknight.me).

I ended up getting a [LAMY AL-star](https://www.lamy.com/en-gb/p/lamy-al-star-fountain-pen/54980238541144) in purple with a fine tip and a [Scribbles That Matter](https://scribblesthatmatter.co.uk/collections/bullet-journals/products/dotted-journal-iconic?variant=39713620295814) notepad.

I don’t write a lot, and the last time I used a fountain pen was likely during [primary school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school). I remember hating writing as a child and disliking fountain pens even more, but I'm an adult now, and after trying some of Robb’s pens and liking them, I thought I’d try it again properly.

Turns out I like it. I still think my writing leaves a lot to be desired, and I'm not completely used to the fountain pen aspects, but overall, my experience has been positive. Turns out good tools and a willingness to learn go a long way, who'd've guessed.

## Holiday

I returned to [Jersey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey) as I do every year for the holidays. This was a shorter trip than usual (two weeks), and I didn’t have a whole lot planned.

Not having the laptop with me was deeply frustrating for the first week; having ideas and not really being able to act on them was a new experience for me. It eventually sank in, and I got used to not thinking about programming all the time.

I eventually settled into a routine of reading a [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&_Dragons) book and watching TV while taking notes for ideas that I came across or riffs on things I saw.

Though it was hard, this was a good reset and let me think a lot more than I normally allow before acting. I’m not sure this will last long once I return to my normal routine, but it’s been a fun experiment.

Much like in [August](/blog/monthly-notes-august-2025), the ‘this doesn’t feel like home’ feeling returned, though this time I didn’t feel like Portsmouth was my home either. I felt in limbo, which was somewhat unpleasant.

### Running

I ran a surprising amount while away.

I went to [parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/) run again, it was great, though with dramatically different conditions from the summer. The highlight of this was running on Christmas and New Year’s Day. I would never have thought it’d be something I’d do, but here we are. I am thankful that I was able to get a lift there, as this turned out to be much more important to me than I thought it would be.

While I was there, I also tackled two runs I was nervous about. 

The first was around my local lanes. I meant to do it in the summer, but I didn’t. I was nervous for two reasons. One, I know these lanes well; I spent a lot of my youth there. Two, I know just how hilly those roads are, and I am not a fan of hills. As expected, it was hard, but again, weirdly rewarding.

The second was a long run. My Mum needed to run an errand near [Gorey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorey,_Jersey), so I decided to run from town to there along the coast road. Again, a route I know really well and was nervous about. This was much tougher, the weather was unpleasant – a persistent cold headwind with strong gusts – and the route had less pavement than I expected. But I did it, and again, I'm weirdly proud of it.

I think I really need to ‘conquer’ Jersey; there’s a lot of emotion I have suppressed there, and running – and hopefully cycling – around it might help me process it. Almost all locations there hold memories, and the zen state that exercise grants might be perfect for processing this. Also, running around these places and actually enjoying being out in the weather and environment is a new experience for me, and is reframing almost everything I thought I knew about those places.

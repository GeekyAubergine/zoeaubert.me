This was not a good month. I injured my heel at the start of the month, and it ruined the rest of the month for me.

## Injury

I’m not sure what happened. I just woke up one day with my heel hurting a lot and it being hard to put weight on. I quickly ruled out tendon issues and concluded I must’ve whacked it on something without noticing and bruised it.

This theory seems right, as it passed after about a week. I was able to run on it again shortly after, and the cause remains a mystery.

Unfortunately, this meant I had to pull out of a half-marathon I had planned with [Wade](https://www.iwader.co.uk/posts/2025/11/running-my-first-half-marathon/), but I was able to give my place to a friend who ran it with him. 

I’m annoyed I didn’t get to do it; the weather seemed great after the awful conditions of the Great South Run in [October](/blog/monthly-notes-october-2025), but I’m pleased Wade got to run it and seemed to have a good time.

## Linux

After much discussion and doubt, I decided to build a dedicated development machine this month. Previously, I had been using a MacBook Pro M2 Max as my main machine, but I would soon lose access to it, so I needed a suitable replacement.

I did initially consider going with Apple again, but I cannot support that company based on their recent actions. Windows is a non-starter, so Linux it was.

This has been an excellent move. The hardware is hilariously more capable for ¼ the cost, and runs nearly silently unless I really stress it. [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/](https://fedoraproject.org/) is great, it just worked, isn’t full of bloatware – or spyware – and makes great use of resources. Despite my best efforts, I rarely get my resource utilisation up to where the MacBook sat idling, which says it all.

I am still a little nervous about the setup. I know my mistrust is somewhat unfounded, but I am worried about Linux’s stability, particularly around updates. So far, I’ve been proven wrong, and I hope it will continue, because this has been great.

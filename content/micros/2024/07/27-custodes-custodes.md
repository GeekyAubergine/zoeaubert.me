Second game of the 500 point league, and I got to play against the Custodes again.

This game was very interesting, I was blown away by how quickly the Custodes can cut down all enimies, including themselves.

My oponents Blade Champion did some real work to my Custodes, it put out a surprisingly amount of damage.

MVP was my Custodian Warden with Vexilla. As you can see in the last image, h was able to hold against three Terminators living with a single wound. He then managed to cut down on of the Terminators which lead to him controlling the objective and winning me the game. He has earnt the name "Vestus" for his efforts.

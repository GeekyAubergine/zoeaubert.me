Third game of the 500 point league.

Due to some people having to leave, I ended up playing with my Custodes opponent in a 1k game against Space Marines.

We changed out lists a bit, I dropped my Blade Champion for some more bodies. My team mate chose to go entirely vehicle based with a Armiger, Dreadnought, and some bikes.

Unfortunalte, as my half of the force was very slow and my team mate was very fast, we ended up getting split up and picked off with relative easy.

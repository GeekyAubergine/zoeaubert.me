This was the start of our 500 point tournament. I brought my Custodes and my opponent brought their wonderfully painted Chaos Space Marines.

I got very lucky with some huge advances and charges, letting me get across the board in my first turn. From there their units melted and there was little they could do.

I look forward to playing them again at a hopefully more balanced points level.

description: On a walk with a friend we noticed a pair of swans with some cygnets in the distance. We decided to sit down on the beach and take some photos of them. The swans then decided to talk down towards and past us allowing for some excellent photos. Swans are a lot bigger than I expected up close and are a little scary.
